<H2>NAME</H2>

sssd-krb5 - the configuration file for SSSD
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This manual page describes the configuration of the Kerberos 5 authentication backend for
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+sssd">sssd</A></B>(8). For a detailed syntax reference, please refer to the
lqFILE FORMATrq
section of the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+sssd.conf">sssd.conf</A></B>(5)
manual page
<P>

The Kerberos 5 authentication backend contains auth and chpass providers. It must be paired with identity provider in order to function properly (for example, id_provider = ldap). Some information required by the Kerberos 5 authentication backend must be provided by the identity provider, such as the user's Kerberos Principal Name (UPN). The configuration of the identity provider should have an entry to specify the UPN. Please refer to the man page for the applicable identity provider for details on how to configure this.
<P>

This backend also provides access control based on the .k5login file in the home directory of the user. See
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+.k5login">.k5login</A></B>(5)
for more details. Please note that an empty .k5login file will deny all access to this user. To activate this feature use 'access_provider = krb5' in your sssd configuration.
<P>

In the case where the UPN is not available in the identity backend
<B>sssd</B>
will construct a UPN using the format
<I>username</I>@<I>krb5_realm</I>.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

If the auth-module krb5 is used in a SSSD domain, the following options must be used. See the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+sssd.conf">sssd.conf</A></B>(5)
manual page, section
lqDOMAIN SECTIONSrq
for details on the configuration of a SSSD domain.
<P>

krb5_server (string)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Specifies the comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames of the Kerberos servers to which SSSD should connect in the order of preference. For more information on failover and server redundancy, see the
lqFAILOVERrq
section. An optional port number (preceded by a colon) may be appended to the addresses or hostnames. If empty, service discovery is enabled - for more information, refer to the
lqSERVICE DISCOVERYrq
section.
<P>
When using service discovery for KDC or kpasswd servers, SSSD first searches for DNS entries that specify _udp as the protocol and falls back to _tcp if none are found.
<P>
This option was named
lqkrb5_kdciprq
in earlier releases of SSSD. While the legacy name is recognized for the time being, users are advised to migrate their config files to use
lqkrb5_serverrq
instead.
</DL>

<P>

krb5_realm (string)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The name of the Kerberos realm. This option is required and must be specified.
</DL>

<P>

krb5_kpasswd (string)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If the change password service is not running on the KDC alternative servers can be defined here. An optional port number (preceded by a colon) may be appended to the addresses or hostnames.
<P>
For more information on failover and server redundancy, see the
lqFAILOVERrq
section. Please note that even if there are no more kpasswd servers to try the back end is not switch to offline if authentication against the KDC is still possible.

<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+chmod">chmod</A></B>(1)
for details) is created.
<P>
Default: /tmp
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FAILOVER</H2>

<P>

The failover feature allows back ends to automatically switch to a different server if the primary server fails.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Failover Syntax</H3>

<P>

The list of servers is given as a comma-separated list; any number of spaces is allowed around the comma. The servers are listed in order of preference. The list can contain any number of servers.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The Failover Mechanism</H3>

<P>

The failover mechanism distinguishes between a machine and a service. The back end first tries to resolve the hostname of a given machine; if this resolution attempt fails, the machine is considered offline. No further attempts are made to connect to this machine for any other service. If the resolution attempt succeeds, the back end tries to connect to a service on this machine. If the service connection attempt fails, then only this particular service is considered offline and the back end automatically switches over to the next service. The machine is still considered online and might still be tried for another service.
<P>

Further connection attempts are made to machines or services marked as offline after a specified period of time; this is currently hard coded to 30 seconds.
<P>

If there are no more machines to try, the back end as a whole switches to offline mode, and then attempts to reconnect every 30 seconds.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SERVICE DISCOVERY</H2>

<P>

The service discovery feature allows back ends to automatically find the appropriate servers to connect to using a special DNS query.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Configuration</H3>

<P>

If no servers are specified, the back end automatically uses service discovery to try to find a server. Optionally, the user may choose to use both fixed server addresses and service discovery by inserting a special keyword,
lq_srv_rq, in the list of servers. The order of preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers can be discovered using DNS.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The domain name</H3>

<P>

Please refer to the
lqdns_discovery_domainrq
parameter in the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+sssd.conf">sssd.conf</A></B>(5)
manual page for more details.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The protocol</H3>

<P>

The queries usually specify _tcp as the protocol. Exceptions are documented in respective option description.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>See Also</H3>

<P>

For more information on the service discovery mechanism, refer to RFC 2782.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>

The following example assumes that SSSD is correctly configured and FOO is one of the domains in the
<I>[sssd]</I>
section. This example shows only configuration of Kerberos authentication, it does not include any identity provider.
<P>
