dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
<B>options</B>

from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.   When configuring
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+dhcpd">dhcpd</A>(8)</B>

or
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+dhclient">dhclient</A>(8) ,</B>

options must often be declared.   The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS</H2>

<P>

DHCP <I>option</I> statements always start with the <I>option</I>
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.   It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
<P>

Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
<P>

The
<B>ip-address</B>

data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
<P>

The
<B>ip6-address</B>

data specifies an IPv6 address, like ::1 or 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1.
<P>

The
<B>int32</B>

data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The 
<B>uint32</B>

data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The 
<B>int16</B>

and
<B>uint16</B>

data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The 
<B>int8</B>

and
<B>uint8</B>

data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
<P>

The
<B>text</B>

data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a root-path
option, the syntax would be
<PRE>

option root-path &quot;10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

The
<B>domain-name</B>

data type specifies a domain name, which must not be
enclosed in double quotes.   This data type is not used for any
existing DHCP options.   The domain name is stored just as if it were
a text option.
<P>

The
<B>domain-list</B>

data type specifies a list of domain names, enclosed in double quotes and
separated by commas (&quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;foo.example.com&quot;).
<P>

The
<B>flag</B>

data type specifies a boolean value.   Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
<P>

The
<B>string</B>

data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.   For example:
<PRE>

  option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;CLIENT-FOO&quot;;
or
  option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
</PRE>

<P>

The
<B>destination-descriptor</B>

describe the IP subnet number and subnet mask
of a particular destination using a compact encoding. This encoding
consists of one octet describing the width of the subnet mask,
followed by all the significant octets of the subnet number.
The following table contains some examples of how various subnet
number/mask combinations can be encoded:
<PRE>

Subnet number   Subnet mask      Destination descriptor
0               0                0
10.0.0.0        255.0.0.0        8.10
10.0.0.0        255.255.255.0    24.10.0.0
10.17.0.0       255.255.0.0      16.10.17
10.27.129.0     255.255.255.0    24.10.27.129
10.229.0.128    255.255.255.128  25.10.229.0.128
10.198.122.47   255.255.255.255  32.10.198.122.47
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS</H2>

Sometimes it's helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option
based on some value that the client has sent.   To do this, you can
use expression evaluation.   The 
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+dhcp-eval">dhcp-eval</A>(5)</B>

manual page describes how to write expressions.   To assign the result
of an evaluation to an option, define the option as follows:
<PRE>

  <B>option </B><I>my-option </I><B>= </B><I>expression </I><B>;</B>
</PRE>

<P>

For example:
<PRE>

  option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, &quot;-&quot;,
                                     substring (hardware, 1, 6));
</PRE>

<H2>STANDARD DHCPV4 OPTIONS</H2>

The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.  Options not
listed below may not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use
such options by defining them in the configuration file.  Please see
the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this document for more
information.
<P>

Some of the options documented here are automatically generated by
the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot be configured by the user.
The value of such an option can be used in the configuration file of
the receiving DHCP protocol agent (server or client), for example in
conditional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot be
used in the configuration file of the sending agent, because the value
is determined only <I>after</I> the configuration file has been
processed. In the following documentation, such options will be shown
as &quot;not user configurable&quot;
<P>

The standard options are:
<P>

<B>option all-subnets-local</B> <I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all
subnets of the IP network to which the client is connected use the
same MTU as the subnet of that network to which the client is
directly connected.  A value of true indicates that all subnets share
the same MTU.  A value of false means that the client should assume that
some subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option arp-cache-timeout</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option bcms-controller-address</B> <I>ip-address</I> [<B>,</B>

<I>ip-address</I>... ]<B>;</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option configures a list of IPv4 addresses for use as Broadcast and
Multicast Controller Servers (&quot;BCMS&quot;).
</DL>

<P>

<B>option bcms-controller-names</B> <I>domain-list</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option contains the domain names of local Broadcast and
Multicast Controller Servers (&quot;BCMS&quot;) controllers which the client
may use.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option bootfile-name</B> <I>text</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.  If supported by the
client, it should have the same effect as the <B>filename</B>
declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some
DHCP clients will support it, and others actually require it.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option boot-size</B> <I>uint16</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default
boot image for the client.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option broadcast-address</B> <I>ip-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's
subnet.  Legal values for broadcast addresses are specified in
section 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).
</DL>

<P>

<B>option cookie-servers</B> <I>ip-address</I> [<B>,</B> <I>ip-address</I>...

]<B>;</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie
servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order
of preference.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option default-ip-ttl</B> <I>uint8;</I>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should
use on outgoing datagrams.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option default-tcp-ttl</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when
sending TCP segments.  The minimum value is 1.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option default-url</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The format and meaning of this option is not described in any standards
document, but is claimed to be in use by Apple Computer.  It is not known
what clients may reasonably do if supplied with this option.  Use at your
own risk.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-client-identifier</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option can be used to specify a DHCP client identifier in a
host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the host record by matching
against the client identifier.
<P>

Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured with client
identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a zero to the ASCII
text.   So you may need to write:
<PRE>

        option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;\0foo&quot;;

rather than:

        option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;foo&quot;;
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-lease-time</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST)
to allow the client to request a lease time for the IP address.  In a
server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify
the lease time it is willing to offer.                                    
<P>

This option is not directly user configurable in the server; refer to the
<I>max-lease-time</I> and <I>default-lease-time</I> server options in
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf</A>(5).</B>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-max-message-size</B> <I>uint16</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option, when sent by the client, specifies the maximum size of
any response that the server sends to the client.   When specified on
the server, if the client did not send a dhcp-max-message-size option,
the size specified on the server is used.   This works for BOOTP as
well as DHCP responses.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-message</B> <I>text</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a
DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event of a failure. A client
may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate why the
client declined the offered parameters.
<P>

This option is not user configurable.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-message-type</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option, sent by both client and server, specifies the type of DHCP
message contained in the DHCP packet. Possible values (taken directly from
RFC2132) are:
<P>

<PRE>
             1     DHCPDISCOVER
             2     DHCPOFFER
             3     DHCPREQUEST
             4     DHCPDECLINE
             5     DHCPACK
             6     DHCPNAK
             7     DHCPRELEASE
             8     DHCPINFORM               
</PRE>

<P>

This option is not user configurable.
<P>

</DL>

<B>option dhcp-option-overload</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used to indicate that the DHCP 'sname' or 'file'
fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP options. A
DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will
exceed the usual space allotted for options.
<P>

If this option is present, the client interprets the specified
additional fields after it concludes interpretation of the standard
option fields.
<P>

Legal values for this option are:
<P>

<PRE>
             1     the 'file' field is used to hold options
             2     the 'sname' field is used to hold options
             3     both fields are used to hold options                        
</PRE>

<P>

This option is not user configurable.
<P>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-parameter-request-list</B> <I>uint16</I> [<B>,</B>

<I>uint16</I>... ]<B>;</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option, when sent by the client, specifies which options the
client wishes the server to return.   Normally, in the ISC DHCP
client, this is done using the <I>request</I> statement.   If this
option is not specified by the client, the DHCP server will normally
return every option that is valid in scope and that fits into the
reply.   When this option is specified on the server, the server
returns the specified options.   This can be used to force a client to
take options that it hasn't requested, and it can also be used to
tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients that may need a
more limited set of options than those the server would normally
return.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-rebinding-time</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets
an address until the client transitions to the REBINDING state.
<P>

This option is not user configurable.
<P>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-renewal-time</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets
an address until the client transitions to the RENEWING state.
<P>

This option is not user configurable.
<P>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-requested-address</B> <I>ip-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to
request that a particular IP address be assigned.                 
<P>

This option is not user configurable.
<P>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp-server-identifier</B> <I>ip-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may
optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.  DHCP
servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the
client to distinguish between lease offers.  DHCP clients use the
contents of the 'server identifier' field as the destination address
for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP clients also
indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by including
this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.
<P>

The value of this option is the IP address of the server.
<P>

This option is not directly user configurable. See the 
<I>server-identifier</I> server option in
<B></B><I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+dhcpd.conf">dhcpd.conf</A>(5).</I>

<P>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option domain-name</B> <I>text</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the domain name that client should use when
resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option domain-name-servers</B> <I>ip-address</I> [<B>,</B> <I>ip-address</I>...

]<B>;</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The domain-name-servers option specifies a list of Domain Name System
(STD 13, RFC 1035) name servers available to the client.  Servers
should be listed in order of preference.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option domain-search</B> <I>domain-list</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The domain-search option specifies a 'search list' of Domain Names to be
used by the client to locate not-fully-qualified domain names.  The difference
between this option and historic use of the domain-name option for the same
ends is that this option is encoded in RFC1035 compressed labels on the wire.
For example:
<PRE>

  option domain-search &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;sales.example.com&quot;,
                       &quot;eng.example.com&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

This option specifies a list of X Window System Font servers available
to the client. Servers should be listed in order of preference.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option host-name</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the name of the client.  The name may or may
not be qualified with the local domain name (it is preferable to use
the domain-name option to specify the domain name).  See RFC 1035 for
character set restrictions.  This option is only honored by
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+dhclient-script">dhclient-script</A>(8)</B>

if the hostname for the client machine is not set.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option ieee802-3-encapsulation</B> <I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies whether or not the client should use Ethernet
Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042) encapsulation if the
interface is an Ethernet.  A value of false indicates that the client
should use RFC 894 encapsulation.  A value of true means that the client
should use RFC 1042 encapsulation.
</DL>

<P>

available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of
preference.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option interface-mtu</B> <I>uint16</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the MTU to use on this interface.   The minimum
legal value for the MTU is 68.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option ip-forwarding</B> <I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

the SLP agent should just use the IP addresses given.   If the value
is false, the SLP agent may additionally do active or passive
multicast discovery of SLP agents (see RFC2165 for details).
<P>

Please note that in this option and the slp-service-scope option, the
term &quot;SLP Agent&quot; is being used to refer to a Service Location Protocol
agent running on a machine that is being configured using the DHCP
protocol.
<P>

Also, please be aware that some companies may refer to SLP as NDS.
If you have an NDS directory agent whose address you need to

agent should only use the list of scopes provided in this option;
otherwise, it may use its own static configuration in preference to
the list provided in this option.
<P>

The text string should be a comma-separated list of scopes that the

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies a list of static routes that the client should
install in its routing cache.  If multiple routes to the same
destination are specified, they are listed in descending order of
priority.
<P>

The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs.  The first address
is the destination address, and the second address is the router for
the destination.
<P>

The default route (0.0.0.0) is an illegal destination for a static
route.  To specify the default route, use the
<B>routers</B>

option.   Also, please note that this option is not intended for
classless IP routing - it does not include a subnet mask.   Since
classless IP routing is now the most widely deployed routing standard,
this option is virtually useless, and is not implemented by any of the
popular DHCP clients, for example the Microsoft DHCP client.
<P>

NOTE to Fedora dhclient users:
<BR>

dhclient-script interprets trailing 0 octets of the target as indicating
the subnet class of the route, so for the following static-routes value:

<P>

This option (see RFC3442) specifies a list of classless static routes

<P>

This option can contain one or more static routes, each of which
consists of a destination descriptor and the IP address of the router
that should be used to reach that destination.
<P>

Many clients may not implement the Classless Static Routes option.
DHCP server administrators should therefore configure their DHCP
servers to send both a Router option and a Classless Static Routes
option, and should specify the default router(s) both in the Router
option and in the Classless Static Routes option.

This option is used by some DHCP clients as a way for users to
specify identifying information to the client.   This can be used in a
similar way to the vendor-class-identifier option, but the value of
the option is specified by the user, not the vendor.   Most recent
DHCP clients have a way in the user interface to specify the value for
this identifier, usually as a text string.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option vendor-class-identifier</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is used by some DHCP clients to identify the vendor
type and possibly the configuration of a DHCP client.  The information
is a string of bytes whose contents are specific to the vendor and are
not specified in a standard.   To see what vendor class identifier
clients are sending, you can write the following in your DHCP server
configuration file:
<PRE>

set vendor-string = option vendor-class-identifier;
</PRE>

<P>

This will result in all entries in the DHCP server lease database file
for clients that sent vendor-class-identifier options having a set
statement that looks something like this:
<PRE>

set vendor-string = &quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot;;
</PRE>

The vendor-class-identifier option is normally used by the DHCP server

configuration file - instead, a vendor class is defined for each
vendor, vendor class suboptions are defined, values for those
suboptions are defined, and the DHCP server makes up a response on
that basis.
<P>

Some default behaviours for well-known DHCP client vendors (currently,
the Microsoft Windows 2000 DHCP client) are configured automatically,

<H2>RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION</H2>

An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series
of encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP packet
when relaying it to the DHCP server.   The server can then make
address allocation decisions (or whatever other decisions it wants)
based on these options.   The server also returns these options in any
replies it sends through the relay agent, so that the relay agent can
use the information in these options for delivery or accounting
purposes.
<P>

The current draft defines two options.   To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space name,
&quot;agent&quot;, followed by a period, followed by the option name.   It is
not normally useful to define values for these options in the server,
although it is permissible.   These options are not supported in the
client.
<P>

<B>option agent.circuit-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The circuit-id suboption encodes an agent-local identifier of the
circuit from which a DHCP client-to-server packet was received.  It is
intended for use by agents in relaying DHCP responses back to the
proper circuit.   The format of this option is currently defined to be
vendor-dependent, and will probably remain that way, although the
current draft allows for for the possibility of standardizing the
format in the future.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option agent.remote-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The remote-id suboption encodes information about the remote host end
of a circuit.   Examples of what it might contain include caller ID
information, username information, remote ATM address, cable modem ID,
and similar things.   In principal, the meaning is not well-specified,
and it should generally be assumed to be an opaque object that is
administratively guaranteed to be unique to a particular remote end of
a circuit.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option agent.DOCSIS-device-class</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The DOCSIS-device-class suboption is intended to convey information about
the host endpoint, hardware, and software, that either the host operating
system or the DHCP server may not otherwise be aware of (but the relay is
able to distinguish).  This is implemented as a 32-bit field (4 octets),
each bit representing a flag describing the host in one of these ways.
So far, only bit zero (being the least significant bit) is defined in
RFC3256.  If this bit is set to one, the host is considered a CPE
Controlled Cable Modem (CCCM).  All other bits are reserved.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option agent.link-selection</B> <I>ip-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The link-selection suboption is provided by relay agents to inform servers
what subnet the client is actually attached to.  This is useful in those
cases where the giaddr (where responses must be sent to the relay agent)
is not on the same subnet as the client.  When this option is present in
a packet from a relay agent, the DHCP server will use its contents to find
a subnet declared in configuration, and from here take one step further
backwards to any shared-network the subnet may be defined within...the
client may be given any address within that shared network, as normally
appropriate.

<H2>THE CLIENT FQDN SUBOPTIONS</H2>

The Client FQDN option, currently defined in the Internet Draft
draft-ietf-dhc-fqdn-option-00.txt is not a standard yet, but is in
sufficiently wide use already that we have implemented it.   Due to
the complexity of the option format, we have implemented it as a
suboption space rather than a single option.   In general this
option should not be configured by the user - instead it should be
used as part of an automatic DNS update system.
<P>

<B>option fqdn.no-client-update </B><I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.server-update </B><I>flag</I><B>;</B>

has updated (or is about to update) the client's A record.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.encoded </B><I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If true, this indicates that the domain name included in the option is
encoded in DNS wire format, rather than as plain ASCII text.   The client
normally sets this to false if it doesn't support DNS wire format in the
FQDN option.   The server should always send back the same value that the
client sent.   When this value is set on the configuration side, it controls
the format in which the <I>fqdn.fqdn</I> suboption is encoded.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.rcode1 </B><I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.rcode2 </B><I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

These options specify the result of the updates of the A and PTR records,
respectively, and are only sent by the DHCP server to the DHCP client.
The values of these fields are those defined in the DNS protocol specification.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.fqdn </B><I>text</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Specifies the domain name that the client wishes to use.   This can be a
fully-qualified domain name, or a single label.   If there is no trailing

generally update that name in some locally-defined domain.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.hostname </B><I>--never set--</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option should never be set, but it can be read back using the <B>option</B>
and <B>config-option</B> operators in an expression, in which case it returns
the first label in the <B>fqdn.fqdn</B> suboption - for example, if
the value of <B>fqdn.fqdn</B> is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then <B>fqdn.hostname</B>
will be &quot;foo&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option fqdn.domainname </B><I>--never set--</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option should never be set, but it can be read back using the <B>option</B>
and <B>config-option</B> operators in an expression, in which case it returns
all labels after the first label in the <B>fqdn.fqdn</B> suboption - for
example, if the value of <B>fqdn.fqdn</B> is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;,
then <B>fqdn.hostname</B> will be &quot;example.com.&quot;.   If this suboption value
is not set, it means that an unqualified name was sent in the fqdn option,
or that no fqdn option was sent at all.
</DL>

<P>

If you wish to use any of these suboptions, we strongly recommend that you
refer to the Client FQDN option draft (or standard, when it becomes a
standard) - the documentation here is sketchy and incomplete in comparison,
and is just intended for reference by people who already understand the
Client FQDN option specification.

<H2>THE NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS</H2>

RFC2242 defines a set of encapsulated options for Novell NetWare/IP
clients.  To use these options in the dhcp server, specify the option
space name, &quot;nwip&quot;, followed by a period, followed by the option name.
The following options can be specified:
<P>

<B>option nwip.nsq-broadcast</B> <I>flag</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If true, the client should use the NetWare Nearest Server Query to
locate a NetWare/IP server.   The behaviour of the Novell client if
this suboption is false, or is not present, is not specified.
<P>

</DL>

<B>option nwip.preferred-dss</B> <I>ip-address</I> [<B>,</B> <I>ip-address</I>... ]<B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

to communicate with a given DSS server at startup.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option nwip.autoretry-secs</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Specifies the number of seconds that a Netware/IP client should wait
between retries when attempting to establish communications with a DSS
server at startup.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option nwip.nwip-1-1</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If true, the NetWare/IP client should support NetWare/IP version 1.1
compatibility.   This is only needed if the client will be contacting
Netware/IP version 1.1 servers.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option nwip.primary-dss</B> <I>ip-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

utility uses this value as Primary DSS server when configuring a
secondary DSS server.
</DL>

<H2>STANDARD DHCPV6 OPTIONS</H2>

DHCPv6 options differ from DHCPv4 options partially due to using
16-bit code and length tags, but semantically zero-length options
are legal in DHCPv6, and multiple options are treated differently.
Whereas in DHCPv4 multiple options would be concatenated to form one
option, in DHCPv6 they are expected to be individual instantiations.
Understandably, many options are not &quot;allowed&quot; to have multiple
instances in a packet - normally these are options which are digested
by the DHCP protocol software, and not by users or applications.
<P>

<B>option dhcp6.client-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the client's DUID identifier.  DUIDs are similar
but different from DHCPv4 client identifiers - there are documented duid
types:
<P>

<I>duid-llt</I>

<P>

<I>duid-en</I>

<P>

<I>duid-ll</I>

<P>

This value should not be configured, but rather is provided by clients
and treated as an opaque identifier key blob by servers.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.server-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option specifies the server's DUID identifier.  One may use this
option to configure an opaque binary blob for your server's identifier.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.ia-na</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (ia-na) carries
assigned addresses that are not temporary addresses for use by the
DHCPv6 client.  This option is produced by the DHCPv6 server software,
and should not be configured.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.ia-ta</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The Identity Association for Temporary Addresses (ia-ta) carries
temporary addresses, which may change upon every renewal.  There is
no support for this in the current DHCPv6 software.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.ia-addr</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The Identity Association Address option is encapsulated inside ia-na
or ia-ta options in order to represent addresses associated with those
IA's.  These options are manufactured by the software, so should not
be configured.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.oro</B> <I>uint16</I> [ <B>,</B> <I>uint16</I><B>,</B> ... ]<B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The Option Request Option (&quot;ORO&quot;) is the DHCPv6 equivalent of the
parameter-request-list.  Clients supply this option to ask servers
to reply with options relevant to their needs and use.  This option
must not be directly configured, the request syntax in dhclient.conf (5)
should be used instead.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.preference</B> <I>uint8</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>preference</B> option informs a DHCPv6 client which server is

applied during the initial stages of configuration - once a client
is bound to an IA, it will remain bound to that IA until it is no
longer valid or has expired.  This value may be configured on the
server, and is digested by the client software.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.elapsed-time</B> <I>uint16</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>elapsed-time</B> option is constructed by the DHCPv6 client
software, and is potentially consumed by intermediaries.  This
option should not be configured.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.relay-msg</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>relay-msg</B> option is constructed by intervening DHCPv6
relay agent software.  This option is entirely used by protocol
software, and is not meant for user configuration.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.unicast</B> <I>ip6-address</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>unicast</B> option is provided by DHCPv6 servers which are
willing (or prefer) to receive Renew packets from their clients
by exchanging UDP unicasts with them.  Normally, DHCPv6 clients
will multicast their Renew messages.  This may be configured on
the server, and should be configured as an address the server
is ready to reply to.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.status-code</B> <I>status-code</I> [ <I>string</I> ] <B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>status-code</B> option is provided by DHCPv6 servers to inform
clients of error conditions during protocol communication.  This option
is manufactured and digested by protocol software, and should not be
configured.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.rapid-commit</B> <B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>rapid-commit</B> option is a zero-length option that clients use
to indicate their desire to enter into rapid-commit with the server.  This
option is not supported by the client at this time, and is digested by
the server when present, so should not be configured.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.vendor-opts</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>vendor-opts</B> option is actually an encapsulated sub-option space,
in which each Vendor-specific Information Option (VSIO) is identified by
a 32-bit Enterprise-ID number.  The encapsulated option spaces within these
options are defined by the vendors.
<P>

To make use of this option, the best way is to examine the section
titled VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS below, in particular the bits about
the &quot;vsio&quot; option space.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.interface-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>interface-id</B> option is manufactured by relay agents, and may
be used to guide configuration differentiating clients by the interface
they are remotely attached to.  It does not make sense to configure a
value for this option, but it may make sense to inspect its contents.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.reconf-msg</B> <I>dhcpv6-message</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>reconf-msg</B> option is manufactured by servers, and sent to
clients in Reconfigure messages to inform them of what message
the client should Reconfigure using.  There is no support for
DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this option is documented
informationally only.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.reconf-accept ;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>reconf-accept</B> option is included by DHCPv6 clients that
support the Reconfigure extentions, advertising that they will
respond if the server were to ask them to Reconfigure.  There is
no support for DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this option is
documented informationally only.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.sip-servers-names</B> <I>domain-list</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>sip-servers-names</B> option allows SIP clients to locate a
local SIP server that is to be used for all outbound SIP requests, a
so-called&quot;outbound proxy server.&quot;  If you wish to use manually entered
IPv6 addresses instead, please see the <B>sip-servers-addresses</B> option

</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.domain-search</B> <I>domain-list</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>domain-search</B> option specifies the client's domain search path
to be applied to recursive DNS queries.  It is easiest to describe this as
the &quot;search&quot; line in /etc/resolv.conf.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.ia-pd</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>ia-pd</B> option is manufactured by clients and servers to create a
Prefix Delegation binding - to delegate an IPv6 prefix to the client.  There
is not yet any support for prefix delegation in this software, and this
option is provided informationally only.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.ia-prefix</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>ia-prefix</B> option is placed inside <B>ia-pd</B> options in order

<B>option dhcp6.info-refresh-time</B> <I>uint32</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>info-refresh-time</B> option gives DHCPv6 clients using
Information-request messages a hint as to how long they should between
refreshing the information they were given.  Note that this option will
only be delivered to the client, and be likely to affect the client's
behaviour, if the client requested the option.

<B>option dhcp6.remote-id</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>remote-id</B> option is constructed by relay agents, to inform the
server of details pertaining to what the relay knows about the client (such
as what port it is attached to, and so forth).  The contents of this option
have some vendor-specific structure (similar to VSIO), but we have chosen
to treat this option as an opaque field.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.subscriber-id</B><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>subscriber-id</B> option is an opaque field provided by the relay agent,
which provides additional information about the subscriber in question.  The
exact contents of this option depend upon the vendor and/or the operator's
configuration of the remote device, and as such is an opaque field.
</DL>

<P>

<B>option dhcp6.fqdn</B> <I>string</I><B>;</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>fqdn</B> option is normally constructed by the client or server,
and negotiates the client's Fully Qualified Domain Name, as well as which
party is responsible for Dynamic DNS Updates.  See the section on the
Client FQDN SubOptions for full details (the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 FQDN options
use the same &quot;fqdn.&quot; encapsulated space, so are in all ways identical).

<P>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEFINING NEW OPTIONS</H2>

The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client and server provide the
capability to define new options.   Each DHCP option has a name, a
code, and a structure.   The name is used by you to refer to the
option.   The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option.   The structure describes what the contents of an
option looks like.
<P>

To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not
in use for some other option - for example, you can't use &quot;host-name&quot;
because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is
documented earlier in this manual page.   If an option name doesn't
appear in this manual page, you can use it, but it's probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so you can be
sure that future options don't take your name.   For example, you
might define an option, &quot;local-host-name&quot;, feeling some confidence
that no official DHCP option name will ever start with &quot;local&quot;.
<P>

Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code.  All codes between
224 and 254 are reserved as 'site-local' DHCP options, so you can pick
any one of these for your site (not for your product/application).  In
RFC3942, site-local space was moved from starting at 128 to starting at
224.  In practice, some vendors have interpreted the protocol rather
loosely and have used option code values greater than 128 themselves.
There's no real way to avoid this problem, and it was thought to be
unlikely to cause too much trouble in practice.  If you come across
a vendor-documented option code in either the new or old site-local
spaces, please contact your vendor and inform them about rfc3942.
<P>

The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option
data appears.   The ISC DHCP server currently supports a few simple
types, like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also
supports the ability to define arrays of single types or arrays of
fixed sequences of types.
<P>

New options are declared as follows:
<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<I>definition</I>

<B>;</B>

<P>

The values of
<I>new-name</I>

and
<I>new-code</I>

should be the name you have chosen for the new option and the code you
have chosen.   The
<I>definition</I>

should be the definition of the structure of the option.
<P>

The following simple option type definitions are supported:
<P>

<B>BOOLEAN</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>boolean</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off
(or true or false).   So an example use of the boolean type would be:
<PRE>

option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
option use-zephyr on;

</PRE>

<B>INTEGER</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<I>sign</I>

<B>integer</B>

<I>width</I>

<B>;</B>

<P>

The <I>sign</I> token should either be blank, <I>unsigned</I>
or <I>signed</I>.   The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer.   So for example, the following two
lines show a definition of the sql-connection-max option and its use:
<PRE>

option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
option sql-connection-max 1536;

</PRE>

<B>IP-ADDRESS</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>ip-address</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as
a domain name or as a dotted quad.  So the following is an example use
of the ip-address type:
<PRE>

option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

</PRE>

<B>IP6-ADDRESS</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>ip6-address</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose structure is an IPv6 address must be expressed as
a valid IPv6 address.  The following is an example use of the 
ip6-address type:
<PRE>

option dhcp6.some-server code 1234 = array of ip6-address;
option dhcp6.some-server 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1, 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::2;

</PRE>

<P>

<B>TEXT</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>text</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.   For
example:
<PRE>

option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
option sql-default-connection-name &quot;PRODZA&quot;;

</PRE>

<P>

<B>DATA STRING</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>string</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection
of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text, like the text
type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose
values must be between 0 and FF.   For example:
<PRE>

option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

</PRE>

<P>

<B>DOMAIN-LIST</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>domain-list</B>

<B>[compressed]</B>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose type is <B>domain-list</B> is an RFC1035 formatted (on the
wire, &quot;DNS Format&quot;) list of domain names, separated by root labels.  The
optional <B>compressed</B> keyword indicates if the option should be
compressed relative to the start of the option contents (not the packet
contents).
<P>

When in doubt, omit the <B>compressed</B> keyword.  When the software recieves
an option that is compressed and the <B>compressed</B> keyword is omitted, it
will still decompress the option (relative to the option contents field).  The
keyword only controls whether or not transmitted packets are compressed.
<P>

Note that when
<B>domain-list</B>

formatted options are output as environment variables to
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+dhclient-script">dhclient-script</A>(8),</B>

the standard DNS -escape mechanism is used: they are decimal.  This is
appropriate for direct use in eg /etc/resolv.conf.
<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>

<B>ENCAPSULATION</B>

<P>

<B>option</B>

<I>new-name</I>

<B>code</B>

<I>new-code</I>

<B>=</B>

<B>encapsulate</B>

<I>identifier</I>

<B>;</B>

<P>

An option whose type is <B>encapsulate</B> will encapsulate the
contents of the option space specified in <I>identifier</I>.   Examples
of encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it currently exists
include the vendor-encapsulated-options option, the netware-suboptions
option and the relay-agent-information option.
<PRE>

option space local;
option local.demo code 1 = text;
option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
option local.demo &quot;demo&quot;;

</PRE>

<P>

<B>ARRAYS</B>

<P>

Options can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the
text and data string types, which aren't currently supported in
arrays.   An example of an array definition is as follows:
<PRE>

option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

</PRE>

<B>RECORDS</B>

<P>

Options can also contain data structures consisting of a sequence of
data types, which is sometimes called a record type.   For example:
<PRE>

option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
option contrived-001 on 1772 &quot;contrivance&quot;;

</PRE>

It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for
example:
<PRE>

option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
        ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 };
option static-routes
        10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com 1,
        10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1,
        10.2.0.0 255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;

<H2>VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS</H2>

The DHCP protocol defines the <B>vendor-encapsulated-options</B>
option, which allows vendors to define their own options that will be
sent encapsulated in a standard DHCP option.  It also defines
the <B>Vendor Identified Vendor Sub Options</B> option (&quot;VIVSO&quot;), and the
DHCPv6 protocol defines the <B>Vendor-specific Information Option</B>
(&quot;VSIO&quot;).  The format of all of these options is usually internally a
string of options, similarly to other normal DHCP options.  The VIVSO
and VSIO options differ in that that they contain options that correspond
to vendor Enterprise-ID numbers (assigned by IANA), which then contain
options according to each Vendor's specifications.  You will need to refer
to your vendor's documentation in order to form options to their
specification.
<P>

The value of these options can be set in one of two ways.   The first
way is to simply specify the data directly, using a text string or a
colon-separated list of hexadecimal values.  For help in forming these
strings, please refer to <B>RFC2132</B> for the DHCPv4 <B>Vendor Specific
Information Option</B>, <B>RFC3925</B> for the DHCPv4 <B>Vendor Identified Vendor
Sub Options</B>, or <B>RFC3315</B> for the DHCPv6 <B>Vendor-specific Information
Option</B>.  For example:
<P>

<PRE>
option vendor-encapsulated-options
    2:4:
        AC:11:41:1:
    3:12:
        73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
    4:12:
        2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
option vivso
    00:00:09:bf:0E:
        01:0c:
            48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
option dhcp6.vendor-opts
    00:00:09:bf:
        00:01:00:0c:
            48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
</PRE>

<P>

The second way of setting the value of these options is to have the DHCP
server generate a vendor-specific option buffer.   To do this, you
must do four things: define an option space, define some options in
that option space, provide values for them, and specify that that 
option space should be used to generate the relevant option.
<P>

To define a new option space in which vendor options can be stored,
use the option space statement:
<P>

<B>option</B>

<B>space</B>

<I>name</I>

<B>[ [ code width</B>

<I>number</I>

<B>] [ length width</B>

<I>number</I>

<B>] [ hash size</B>

<I>number</I>

<B>] ] ;</B>

<P>

Where the numbers following <B>code width</B>, <B>length width</B>,
and <B>hash size</B> respectively identify the number of bytes used to
describe option codes, option lengths, and the size in buckets of the
hash tables to hold options in this space (most DHCPv4 option spaces
use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most
DHCPv6 option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths).
<P>

The code and length widths are used in DHCP protocol - you must configure
these numbers to match the applicable option space you are configuring.
They each default to 1.  Valid values for code widths are 1, 2 or 4.
Valid values for length widths are 0, 1 or 2.  Most DHCPv4 option spaces
use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most DHCPv6
option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths.  A zero-byte length produces
options similar to the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Information Option - but
not their contents!
<P>

The hash size defaults depend upon the <B>code width</B> selected, and
may be 254 or 1009.  Valid values range between 1 and 65535.  Note
that the higher you configure this value, the more memory will be used.  It
is considered good practice to configure a value that is slightly larger
than the estimated number of options you plan to configure within the
space.  Previous versions of ISC DHCP (up to and including DHCP 3.0.*),
this value was fixed at 9973.
<P>

The name can then be used in option definitions, as described earlier in
this document.   For example:
<PRE>

option space SUNW code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address;
option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text;
option SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;

option space ISC code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
option ISC.sample code 1 = text;
option vendor.ISC code 2495 = encapsulate vivso-sample;
option vendor-class.ISC code 2495 = text;

option ISC.sample &quot;configuration text here&quot;;
option vendor-class.ISC &quot;vendor class here&quot;;

option space docsis code width 2 length width 2 hash size 17;
option docsis.tftp-servers code 32 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.cablelabs-configuration-file code 33 = text;
option docsis.cablelabs-syslog-servers code 34 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.device-id code 36 = string;
option docsis.time-servers code 37 = array of ip6-address;
option docsis.time-offset code 38 = signed integer 32;
option vsio.docsis code 4491 = encapsulate docsis;

</PRE>

Once you have defined an option space and the format of some options,
you can set up scopes that define values for those options, and you
can say when to use them.   For example, suppose you want to handle
two different classes of clients.   Using the option space definition
shown in the previous example, you can send different option values to
different clients based on the vendor-class-identifier option that the
clients send, as follows:
<P>

<PRE>
class &quot;vendor-classes&quot; {
  match option vendor-class-identifier;
}

subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot; &quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot; {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/sparc&quot;;
}

subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot; &quot;SUNW.i86pc&quot; {
  vendor-option-space SUNW;
  option SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/i86pc&quot;;
}

option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1;
option SUNW.server-name &quot;sundhcp-server17-1&quot;;

option vivso-sample.sample &quot;Hello world!&quot;;

option docsis.tftp-servers ::1;

</PRE>

<P>

As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping rules apply,
so you can define values that are global in the global scope, and only
define values that are specific to a particular class in the local
scope.  The <B>vendor-option-space</B> declaration tells the DHCP
server to use options in the SUNW option space to construct the DHCPv4
<B>vendor-encapsulated-options</B>

option.  This is a limitation of that option - the DHCPv4 VIVSO and the
DHCPv6 VSIO options can have multiple vendor definitions all at once (even
transmitted to the same client), so it is not necessary to configure this.
