groff_tmac - macro files in the roff typesetting system
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

























































































































































The
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+roff">roff</A></B>(7)

type-setting system provides a set of macro packages suitable for
special kinds of documents.
Each macro package stores its macros and definitions in a file called
the package's
<B>tmac file</B>.

The name is deduced from
`<B>T</B><I>roff</I><B>MAC</B><I>ros</I>'.


The tmac files are normal roff source documents, except that they
usually contain only definitions and setup commands, but no text.
All tmac files are kept in a single or a small number of directories,
the
<B>tmac</B>

directories.

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GROFF MACRO PACKAGES</H2>


<I>groff</I>

provides all classical macro packages, some more full packages, and
some secondary packages for special purposes.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Man~Pages</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>man</B>

<DD>
This is the classical macro package for UNIX manual pages
(man~pages); it is quite handy and easy to use; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_man">groff_man</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>doc</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>mdoc</B>

<DD>
An alternative macro package for man~pages mainly used in BSD
systems; it provides many new features, but it is not the standard for
man~pages; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_mdoc">groff_mdoc</A></B>(7).


</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Full Packages</H3>


The packages in this section provide a complete set of macros for
writing documents of any kind, up to whole books.
They are similar in functionality; it is a matter of taste which one
to use.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>me</B>

<DD>
The classical
<I>me</I>

macro package; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_me">groff_me</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>mm</B>

<DD>
The semi-classical
<I>mm</I>

macro package; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_mm">groff_mm</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>mom</B>

<DD>
The new
<I>mom</I>

macro package, only available in groff.
As this is not based on other packages, it can be freely designed.
So it is expected to become quite a nice, modern macro package.
See
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_mom">groff_mom</A></B>(7).

<DT><B>ms</B>

<DD>
The classical
<I>ms</I>

macro package; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_ms">groff_ms</A></B>(7).


</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Special Packages</H3>


The macro packages in this section are not intended for stand-alone
usage, but can be used to add special functionality to any other
macro package or to plain groff.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>tty-char</B>

<DD>
Overrides the definition of standard troff characters and some groff
characters for tty devices.
The optical appearance is intentionally inferior compared to that of
normal tty formatting to allow processing with critical equipment.
<DT><B>www</B>

<DD>
Additions of elements known from the html format, as being used in the
internet (World Wide Web) pages; this includes URL links and mail
addresses; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_www">groff_www</A></B>(7).

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAMING</H2>


In classical roff systems, there was a funny naming scheme for macro
packages, due to a simplistic design in option parsing.
Macro packages were always included by option









when this option was directly followed by its argument without an
intervening space, this looked like a long option preceded by a single
minus [em] a sensation in the computer stone age.
To make this optically working for macro package names, all classical
macro packages choose a name that started with the letter









which was omitted in the naming of the macro file.

For example, the macro package for the man pages was called
<I>man</I>,

while its macro file
<I>tmac.an</I>.

So it could be activated by the argument
<I>an</I>

to option









or









for short.

For similar reasons, macro packages that did not start with an









had a leading









added in the documentation and in talking; for example, the package
corresponding to
<I>tmac.doc</I>

was called
<I>mdoc</I>

in the documentation, although a more suitable name would be
<I>doc</I>.

For, when omitting the space between the option and its argument, the
command line option for activating this package reads










To cope with all situations, actual versions of
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+groff">groff</A></B>(1)

are smart about both naming schemes by providing two macro files
for the inflicted macro packages; one with a leading









the other one without it.
So in
<I>groff</I>,

the
<I>man</I>

macro package may be specified as on of the following four methods:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-m~man</H2>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-man</H2>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-mman</H2>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-m~an</H2>


Recent packages that do not start with









do not use an additional









in the documentation.
For example, the
<I>www</I>

macro package may be specified only as one of the two methods:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-m~www</H2>

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-mwww</H2>


Obviously, variants like
<I>-mmwww</I>

would not make much sense.

A second strange feature of classical troff was to name macro files
according to
<B>R</B><I>tmac.</I><B>name</B><I>.</I>

In modern operating systems, the type of a file is specified as
postfix, the file name extension.
Again, groff copes with this situation by searching both
<I>anything</I><B>.tmac</B>

and
<B>tmac.</B><I>anything</I>

if only
<I>anything</I>

is specified.

The easiest way to find out which macro packages are available on a
system is to check the man~page
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+groff">groff</A></B>(1),

or the contents of the
<I>tmac</I>

directories.

In
<I>groff</I>,

most macro packages are described in~man pages called
<B>groff_</B>I]name](7),

with a leading









for the classical packages.

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INCLUSION</H2>


There are several ways to use a macro package in a document.
The classical way is to specify the troff/groff option


















at run-time; this makes the contents of the macro package
<I>name</I>

available.
In groff, the file
<I>name</I><B>.tmac</B>

is searched within the tmac path; if not found,
<B>tmac.</B><I>name</I>

will be searched for instead.

Alternatively, it is also possible to include a macro file by adding
the request









<I>filename</I>

into the document; the argument must be the full file name of an
existing file, possibly with the directory where it is kept.
In groff, this was improved by the similar request









<I>package</I>,

which added searching in the tmac path, just like option









does.

Note that in order to resolve the









and









requests, the roff preprocessor
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+soelim">soelim</A></B>(1)

must be called if the files to be included need preprocessing.
This can be done either directly by a pipeline on the command line or
by using the troff/groff option









<I>man</I>

calls soelim automatically.

For example, suppose a macro file is stored as
<I>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/macros.tmac</I>

and is used in some document called
<I>docu.roff</I>.


At run-time, the formatter call for this is
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ell_cmd groff~-m~ macrofile~document.roff</H2>


To include the macro file directly in the document either
