<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>wacom </B>

is an X input driver for Wacom devices.
<P>

The
<B>wacom</B>

driver functions as a pointer input device.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SUPPORTED HARDWARE</H2>

This driver supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets only 
need this driver.  USB tablet support is available on some Linux platforms
and requires the wacom kernel driver being loaded before this driver starts.
<P>

Please check <A HREF="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net">http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net</A> for latest updates of Wacom X
and kernel drivers.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING</H2>

When input device hotplugging in the X server is enabled and no
<B>InputDevice</B>

section exists for a compatible tablet device and an
<B>InputClass</B>

section (see <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5x+xorg.conf.d">xorg.conf.d</A>(5x)) assigns this driver for the device, the
<B>wacom</B>

driver creates multiple X devices for each a physical device, one X device
for each available tool. The list of tools is hardware-dependent. See
<B>Option Type</B>

as outlined in the
<B>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</B>

section.
<P>

These tool-specific devices are referred to as parent device and dependent
device.  The parent device is the one presented by the system and the one
that causes the X server to load the
<B>wacom</B>

driver. This parent device then causes the automatic addition of several
dependent devices. If the parent device is unplugged or otherwise removed,
the dependent devices will be automatically removed as well.
<P>

Dependent devices may be assigned tool-specific options through additional
<B>InputClass</B>

sections. We recommend that a
<B>MatchDriver wacom</B>

line is used in these sections in addition to the user-specific pattern.
<P>

Match directives are applied by the X server before the driver is selected.
The type name of the parent device is appended by the driver. It is not
possible to use a
<B>MatchProduct</B>

directive to match against this appended type name.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION DETAILS</H2>

Please refer to <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5x+xorg.conf">xorg.conf</A>(5x) or <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5x+xorg.conf.d">xorg.conf.d</A>(5x) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
<P>

Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. Each device
supports the following entries:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Type</I> <I>stylus|eraser|cursor|pad|touch</I>

<DD>
sets the type of tool the device represents. This option is mandatory.  
The core options, such as &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; or &quot;AlwaysCore&quot;, are  
unnecessary in Gimp if you don't need to move system cursor outside 
of Gimp drawing area.  &quot;pad&quot; is for Intuos 3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet 
ExpressKeys/menu strips, and Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, 
and/or ring.  It is required  for Intuos3,  CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and 
Bamboo if you want to use keystroke features.  &quot;pad&quot; is reported as a 
second tool in the driver. &quot;touch&quot; is for the tablet with touch support. 
Right now only a few Tablet PCs have this feature. 
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Device</I> <I>path</I>

<DD>
sets the path to the special file which represents serial line where
the tablet is plugged.  You have to specify it for each subsection with
the same value if you want to have multiple devices with the same tablet.
This option is mandatory.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Suppress</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the position increment under which not to transmit coordinates.
This entry must be specified only in the first Wacom subsection if you have
multiple devices for one tablet. If you don't specify this entry, the default 
value,  which is 2, will be used. To disable suppression, the entry should be 
specified as 0.  When suppress is defined,  an event will be sent only when at 
least one of the following conditions is met:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;X&nbsp;coordinate&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;one&nbsp;is
greater than suppress;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;Y&nbsp;coordinate&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;one&nbsp;is
greater than suppress;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;one&nbsp;is
greater than suppress;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;current&nbsp;degree&nbsp;of&nbsp;rotation&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous
one of the transducer is greater than suppress;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;absolute&nbsp;wheel&nbsp;value&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;
one is equal to or greater than suppress;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;change&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;tilt&nbsp;value&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;one&nbsp;is&nbsp;equal&nbsp;
to or greater than suppress (if tilt is supported);
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relative&nbsp;wheel&nbsp;value&nbsp;has&nbsp;changed;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;button&nbsp;value&nbsp;has&nbsp;changed;
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proximity&nbsp;has&nbsp;changed.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Mode</I> <I>Relative|Absolute</I>

<DD>
sets the mode of the device.  The default value for stylus, pad and
eraser is Absolute; cursor is Relative;
touch defaults to Relative for tablets with touch pads and Absolute for
touch screens.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>TopX</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0. 
<DT><B>Option </B><I>TopY</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>BottomX</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to width of the tablet.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>BottomY</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to height of the tablet.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>ButtonsOnly</I> <I>on|off</I>

<DD>
disables the device's motion events.  Default to off.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>ButtonM</I> <I>AC</I>

<DD>
reports an action AC when button M is pressed,  where M 
is one of the device supported  button numbers,  it can be 1 
to 32. Wacom uses a driver-internal button mapping, where any physical
button appears to the X server as the button specified by the ButtonM
mapping. Hence, if two physical buttons have the same ButtonM mapping, the
server will think they are the same physical button.
The default action reported to the X server is mouse button M click. Because
X uses buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7 as the four scrolling directions, physical
buttons 4 and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default.
To ignore the button click, i.e., to not report any button click event 
to the X server,  use &quot;0&quot; or &quot;button 0&quot;.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>TPCButton</I> <I>on|off</I>

<DD>
enables the stylus buttons as Tablet PC buttons. If enabled, the stylus
reports button events only when its tip is pressed. If any button is down,
pressing the tip reports a button event for the button. Otherwise if no
button is down, the tip reports as usual.
Default to &quot;on&quot; for Tablet PCs; &quot;off&quot; for all other models. Only available
on the stylus tool.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Touch</I> <I>on|off</I>

<DD>
enables the touch event for Tablet PC that supports touch feature,  i.e., 
system cursor moves when user touches the tablet.  Default to &quot;on&quot; for 
Tablet PCs with touch feature; &quot;off&quot; for all other models.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Rotate</I> <I>CW|CCW|HALF|NONE</I>

<DD>
rotates the tablet orientation counterclockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees (HALF). 
If you have specific tablet mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the mapping will be 
applied before rotation. Rotation must be applied to the parent device
(usually the stylus), rotation settings on in-driver hotplugged devices (see
<B>DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING</B>

) will be ignored. The default is &quot;NONE&quot;.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>PressCurve</I> <I>x1,y1,x2,y2</I>

<DD>
sets pressure curve by control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.  Their values are in range 
from 0..100. The pressure curve is interpreted as Bezier curve with 4
control points, the first and the last control point being fixed on the
coordinates 0/0 and 100/100, respectively. The middle control points are
adjustible by this setting and thus define the shape of the curve.
The input for linear curve (default) is &quot;0,0,100,100&quot;; 
slightly depressed curve (firmer) might be &quot;5,0,100,95&quot;; 
slightly raised curve (softer) might be &quot;0,5,95,100&quot;.
The pressure curve is only applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser,
other devices do not honor this setting.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>DebugLevel</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the level of debugging info for tool-specific messages.  There are 12
levels, specified by the integers between 1 and 12.  All debug messages with
a level less than or equal to the &quot;number&quot; will be logged into the Xorg log
file. This option is only available if the driver was built with debugging
support.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>CommonDBG</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the level of debugging info for common (i.e. not tool-specific) code
paths on the tablet. There are 12 levels, specified by the integers between
1 and 12. All debug messages with a level less than or equal to the
&quot;number&quot; will be logged into the Xorg log file. This option is only
available if the driver was built with debugging support.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>CursorProx</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting movement for cursor in relative mode. 
Default for Intuos series is 10, for Graphire series (including Volitos) is
42. Only available for the cursor/puck device.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>RawSample</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
Set  the  sample  window  size (a sliding average sampling window) for
incoming input tool raw data points.  Default:  4, range of 1 to 20.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Serial</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the serial number associated with the physical device. This allows
to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e. multiple pens). This
option is only available on wacom V devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U). 
To see which serial number belongs to a device, you need to run the utility program, 
xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>ToolSerials</I> <I>number[,type[,label]][;...]</I>

<DD>
sets the list of serial numbered devices that need to be hotplugged for a physical
device. The 'type' option may be any of &quot;pen&quot;, &quot;airbrush&quot;, &quot;artpen&quot;, or &quot;cursor&quot;.
This option is only available on wacom V devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U).
To see which serial number belongs to a device, you need to run the utility program,
xsetwacom, that comes with this driver.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Threshold</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
sets the pressure threshold used to generate a button 1 events of stylus.
The threshold applies to the normalised pressure range of [0..2048].
The default is 27.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>Gesture</I> <I>bool</I>

<DD>
Enable or disable gesture support on the device. Default: off unless the
tablet supports multi-touch.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>ZoomDistance</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
If
<B>Option </B><I>Gesture</I>

is enabled, this option specifies the minimum movement distance before a
zoom gesture is recognized.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>ScrollDistance</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
If
<B>Option </B><I>Gesture</I>

is enabled, this option specifies the minimum movement distance before a
scroll gesture is recognized.
<DT><B>Option </B><I>TapTime</I> <I>number</I>

<DD>
If
<B>Option </B><I>Gesture</I>

is enabled, this option determines the maximum time of a touch event to be
recognized as tap. A press and release event shorter than
<B>TapTime</B>

generates button press and release events. Presses longer than
<B>TapTime</B>

do not generate button events, only motion events.
