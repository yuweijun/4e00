Postfix delivery to external command
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>


<PRE>
<B>pipe</B> [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...
</PRE><A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



The <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+pipe">pipe</A></B>(8) daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue
manager to deliver messages to external commands.
This program expects to be run from the <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+master">master</A></B>(8) process
manager.
<P>
Message attributes such as sender address, recipient address and
next-hop host name can be specified as command-line macros that are
expanded before the external command is executed.
<P>
The <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+pipe">pipe</A></B>(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+bounce">bounce</A></B>(8), <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+defer">defer</A></B>(8) or <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+trace">trace</A></B>(8) daemon as
appropriate.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY</H2>


<PRE>
</PRE>

Some destinations cannot handle more than one recipient per
delivery request. Examples are pagers or fax machines.
In addition, multi-recipient delivery is undesirable when
prepending a <B>Delivered-to:</B> or <B>X-Original-To:</B>
message header.
<P>
To prevent Postfix from sending multiple recipients per delivery
request, specify
<P>
<PRE>
    <I>transport</I><B>_destination_recipient_limit = 1</B>
</PRE>

<P>
in the Postfix <B>main.cf</B> file, where <I>transport</I>
is the name in the first column of the Postfix <B>master.cf</B>
entry for the pipe-based delivery transport.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX</H2>


<PRE>
</PRE>

The external command attributes are given in the <B>master.cf</B>
file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>chroot=</B><I>pathname</I> (optional)<DD>
Change the process root directory and working directory to
the named directory. This happens before switching to the
privileges specified with the <B>user</B> attribute, and
before executing the optional <B>directory=</B><I>pathname</I>
directive. Delivery is deferred in case of failure.
<P>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.
<DT><B>directory=</B><I>pathname</I> (optional)<DD>
Change to the named directory before executing the external command.
The directory must be accessible for the user specified with the
<B>user</B> attribute (see below).
The default working directory is <B>$queue_directory</B>.
Delivery is deferred in case of failure.
<P>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.
<DT><B>eol=</B><I>string</I> (optional, default: <B>\n</B>)<DD>
The output record delimiter. Typically one would use either
<B>\r\n</B> or <B>\n</B>. The usual C-style backslash escape
sequences are recognized: <B>\a \b \f \n \r \t \v
\</B><I>ddd</I> (up to three octal digits) and <B>\\</B>.
<DT><B>flags=BDFORXhqu.&gt;</B> (optional)<DD>
Optional message processing flags. By default, a message is
copied unchanged.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>B</B><DD>
Append a blank line at the end of each message. This is required
by some mail user agents that recognize &quot;<B>From </B>&quot; lines only
when preceded by a blank line.
<DT><B>D</B><DD>
Prepend a &quot;<B>Delivered-To: </B><I>recipient</I>&quot; message header with the
envelope recipient address. Note: for this to work, the
<I>transport</I><B>_destination_recipient_limit</B> must be 1
(see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).
<P>
The <B>D</B> flag also enforces loop detection (Postfix 2.5 and later):
if a message already contains a <B>Delivered-To:</B> header
with the same recipient address, then the message is
returned as undeliverable. The address comparison is case
insensitive.
<P>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.
<DT><B>F</B><DD>
Prepend a &quot;<B>From </B><I>sender time_stamp</I>&quot; envelope header to
the message content.
This is expected by, for example, <B>UUCP</B> software.
<DT><B>O</B><DD>
Prepend an &quot;<B>X-Original-To: </B><I>recipient</I>&quot; message header
with the recipient address as given to Postfix. Note: for this to
work, the <I>transport</I><B>_destination_recipient_limit</B> must be 1
(see SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY above for details).
<P>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.
<DT><B>R</B><DD>
Prepend a <B>Return-Path:</B> message header with the envelope sender
address.
<DT><B>X</B><DD>
Indicate that the external command performs final delivery.
This flag affects the status reported in &quot;success&quot; DSN
(delivery status notification) messages, and changes it
from &quot;relayed&quot; into &quot;delivered&quot;.
<P>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.5.
<DT><B>h</B><DD>
Fold the command-line <B>$original_recipient</B> and
<B>$recipient</B> address domain part
(text to the right of the right-most <B>@</B> character) to
lower case; fold the entire command-line <B>$domain</B> and
<B>$nexthop</B> host or domain information to lower case.
This is recommended for delivery via <B>UUCP</B>.
<DT><B>q</B><DD>
Quote white space and other special characters in the command-line
<B>$sender</B>, <B>$original_recipient</B> and <B>$recipient</B>
address localparts (text to the
left of the right-most <B>@</B> character), according to an 8-bit
transparent version of RFC 822.
This is recommended for delivery via <B>UUCP</B> or <B>BSMTP</B>.
<P>
The result is compatible with the address parsing of command-line
recipients by the Postfix <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+sendmail">sendmail</A></B>(1) mail submission command.
<P>
The <B>q</B> flag affects only entire addresses, not the partial
address information from the <B>$user</B>, <B>$extension</B> or
<B>$mailbox</B> command-line macros.
<DT><B>u</B><DD>
Fold the command-line <B>$original_recipient</B> and
<B>$recipient</B> address localpart (text to
the left of the right-most <B>@</B> character) to lower case.
This is recommended for delivery via <B>UUCP</B>.
<DT><B>.</B><DD>
Prepend &quot;<B>.</B>&quot; to lines starting with &quot;<B>.</B>&quot;. This is needed
by, for example, <B>BSMTP</B> software.
<DT><B>&gt;</B><DD>
Prepend &quot;<B>&gt;</B>&quot; to lines starting with &quot;<B>From </B>&quot;. This is expected
by, for example, <B>UUCP</B> software.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>null_sender</B>=<I>replacement</I> (default: MAILER-DAEMON)<DD>
Replace the null sender address (typically used for delivery
status notifications) with the specified text
when expanding the <B>$sender</B> command-line macro, and
when generating a From_ or Return-Path: message header.
<P>
If the null sender replacement text is a non-empty string
then it is affected by the <B>q</B> flag for address quoting
in command-line arguments.
<P>
The null sender replacement text may be empty; this form
is recommended for content filters that feed mail back into
Postfix. The empty sender address is not affected by the
<B>q</B> flag for address quoting in command-line arguments.
<P>
Caution: a null sender address is easily mis-parsed by
naive software. For example, when the <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+pipe">pipe</A></B>(8) daemon
executes a command such as:
<P>
<PRE>
    <I>Wrong</I>: command -f$sender -- $recipient
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
the command will mis-parse the -f option value when the
sender address is a null string.  For correct parsing,
specify <B>$sender</B> as an argument by itself:
<P>
<PRE>
    <I>Right</I>: command -f $sender -- $recipient
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.
<DT><B>size</B>=<I>size_limit</I> (optional)<DD>
Don't deliver messages that exceed this size limit (in
bytes); return them to the sender instead.
<DT><B>user</B>=<I>username</I> (required)<DD>
<DT><B>user</B>=<I>username</I>:<I>groupname</I><DD>
Execute the external command with the rights of the
specified <I>username</I>.  The software refuses to execute
commands with root privileges, or with the privileges of the
mail system owner. If <I>groupname</I> is specified, the
corresponding group ID is used instead of the group ID of
<I>username</I>.
<DT><B>argv</B>=<I>command</I>... (required)<DD>
The command to be executed. This must be specified as the
last command attribute.
The command is executed directly, i.e. without interpretation of
shell meta characters by a shell command interpreter.
<P>
In the command argument vector, the following macros are recognized
and replaced with corresponding information from the Postfix queue
manager delivery request.
<P>
In addition to the form ${<I>name</I>}, the forms $<I>name</I> and
$(<I>name</I>) are also recognized.  Specify <B>$$</B> where a single
<B>$</B> is wanted.

RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)
</PRE><A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>



Command exit status codes are expected to
follow the conventions defined in &lt;<B>sysexits.h</B>&gt;.
Exit status 0 means normal successful completion.
<P>
Postfix version 2.3 and later support RFC 3463-style enhanced
status codes.  If a command terminates with a non-zero exit
status, and the command output begins with an enhanced
status code, this status code takes precedence over the
non-zero exit status.
<P>
Problems and transactions are logged to <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+syslogd">syslogd</A></B>(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager
can move them to the <B>corrupt</B> queue for further inspection.
