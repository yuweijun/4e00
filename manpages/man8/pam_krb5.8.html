<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The pam_krb5.so module is designed to allow smooth integration of Kerberos 5
password-checking for applications which use PAM.
It creates session-specific credential cache files.


If the system is an AFS client, it will also attempt to obtain tokens
for the local cell, the cell which contains the user's home directory,
and any explicitly-configured cells.
<P>
When a user logs in, the module's authentication function performs a simple
password check and, if possible, obtains Kerberos 5

credentials, caching them for later use.  When the application requests
initialization of credentials (or opens a session), the usual ticket files are
created.  When the application subsequently requests deletion of credentials or
closing of the session, the module deletes the ticket files.  When the
application requests account management, if the module did not participate in
authenticating the user, it will signal libpam to ignore the module.  If the
module did participate in authenticating the user, it will check for an expired
user password and verify the user's authorization using the .k5login file of the
user being authenticated, which is expected to be accessible to the module.

<H2>ARGUMENTS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>debug<DD>
turns on debugging via <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+syslog">syslog</A></B>(3).  Debugging messages are logged with
priority <I>LOG_DEBUG</I>.
<P>
<DT>debug_sensitive<DD>
turns on debugging of sensitive information via <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+syslog">syslog</A></B>(3).  Debug
messages are logged with priority <I>LOG_DEBUG</I>.
<P>
<DT>addressless<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain credentials without address lists.  This may be
necessary if your network uses NAT, and should otherwise not be used.  This
option is deprecated in favor of the <I>noaddresses</I> flag in the
<I>libdefaults</I> section of <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+krb5.conf">krb5.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
<DT>afs_cells=<I>cell.example.com[,...]</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain tokens for the named cells,
in addition to the local cell, for the user.  The module will guess
the principal name of the AFS service for the named cells, or it can
be specified by giving cell in the form
<I>cellname</I><B>=principalname</B>.
<P>
<DT>banner=<I>Kerberos 5</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so how to identify itself when users attempt to change their
passwords.  The default setting is &quot;Kerberos 5&quot;.
<P>
<DT>ccache_dir=<I>/tmp</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so which directory to use for storing credential caches.  The
default setting is <I>/tmp</I>.
<P>
<DT>ccname_template=<I>FILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX</I><DD>
specifies the location in which to place the user's session-specific
credential cache.  This value is treated as a template, and these sequences
are substituted:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%u<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>login&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%U<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>login&nbsp;UID<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%p<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>principal&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%r<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>realm&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%h<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>home&nbsp;directory<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%d<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>the&nbsp;default&nbsp;ccache&nbsp;directory&nbsp;(as&nbsp;set&nbsp;with&nbsp;<I>ccache_dir</I>)<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%P<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>the&nbsp;current&nbsp;process&nbsp;ID<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%%<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>literal&nbsp;'%'<BR>
<BR>

The default setting is &quot;<I>FILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX</I>&quot;.
<P>
<DT>chpw_prompt<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to allow expired passwords to be changed during
authentication attempts.  While this is the traditional behavior exhibited by
&quot;kinit&quot;, it is inconsistent with the behavior expected by PAM, which expects
authentication to (appear to) succeed, only to have password expiration be
flagged by a subsequent call to the account management function.  Some
applications which don't handle password expiration correctly will fail
unconditionally if the user's password is expired, and this flag can be used
to attempt to work around this bug in those applications.
The default is <B>false</B>.
<P>
<DT>cred_session<DD>
specifies that pam_krb5 should create and destroy credential caches, as it
does when the calling application opens and closes a PAM session, when the
calling application establishes and deletes PAM credentials.  This is done
to compensate for applications which expect to create a credential cache but
which don't use PAM session management.  It is usually a harmless redundancy
in applications which don't require it, so this option is enabled by default.
except for services in this list: &quot;<I>sshd</I>&quot;.
<P>
<DT>existing_ticket<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to accept the presence of pre-existing Kerberos credentials
provided by the calling application in the default credential cache as
sufficient to authenticate the user, and to skip any account management checks.
<DT><DD>
DANGER!  Unless validation is also in use, it is relatively easy to produce a
credential cache which looks &quot;good enough&quot; to fool pam_krb5.so.
<P>
<DT>external<DD>
<DT>external=<I>sshd</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to use Kerberos credentials provided by the calling
application during session setup.



This is most often useful for obtaining AFS tokens.
<P>
<DT>forwardable<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so that credentials it obtains should be forwardable.  This
option is deprecated in favor of the <I>forwardable</I> option in the
<I>libdefaults</I> section of <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+krb5.conf">krb5.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
<DT>hosts=<I>host[,...]</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain credentials using the addresses of the given hosts in
addition to the addresses of interfaces on the local workstation.  For example,
if your workstation is behind a masquerading firewall, specifying the
firewall's outward-facing address here should allow Kerberos authentication to
succeed.  This option is deprecated in favor of the <I>extra_addresses</I> flag
in the <I>libdefaults</I> section of <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+krb5.conf">krb5.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
<DT>ignore_unknown_principals<DD>
<DT>ignore_unknown_spn<DD>
<DT>ignore_unknown_upn<DD>
specifies that not pam_krb5 should return a PAM_IGNORE code to libpam
instead of PAM_USER_UNKNOWN for users for whom the determined principal
name is expired or does not exist.
<P>
<DT>keytab=<I>FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so the location of a keytab to use when validating
credentials obtained from KDCs.
<P>



















<DT>minimum_uid=<I>0</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to ignore authentication attempts by users with
UIDs below the specified number.
<P>
<DT>multiple_ccaches<DD>
specifies that pam_krb5 should maintain multiple credential caches for this
service, because it both sets credentials and opens a PAM session, but it
sets the KRB5CCNAME variable after doing only one of the two.  This option is
usually not necessary for most services.
<P>
<DT>no_initial_prompt<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to not ask for a password before attempting authentication,
and to instead allow the Kerberos library to trigger a request for a password
only in cases where one is needed.
<P>
<DT>no_subsequent_prompt<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to only provide the previously-entered password in response
to any request for a password which the Kerberos library might make.
If the calling application does not properly support PAM conversations
(possibly due to limitations of a network protocol which it is serving),
this may be need to be used to prevent the application
from supplying the user's current password in a password-changing
situations when a new password is called for.
<P>
<DT>no_user_check<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to not check if a user exists on the local system, to skip
authorization checks using the user's .k5login file, and to create ccache files
owned by the current process's UID.  This is useful for situations where a
non-privileged server process needs to use Kerberized services on behalf of
remote users who may not have local access.  Note that such a server should
have an encrypted connection with its client in order to avoid allowing the
user's password to be eavesdropped.
<P>
<DT>no_validate<DD>
<DT>no_validate=<I>vlock</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to not attempt to use the local keytab to verify that the TGT
obtained from the realm's servers has not been spoofed.
The <B>libdefaults</B> <B>verify_ap_req_nofail</B> setting can
affect whether or not errors reading the keytab which are encountered during
validation will be suppressed.
<P>
<DT>null_afs<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so, when it attempts to set tokens, to try to get
credentials for services with names which resemble afs@<I>REALM</I>
before attempting to get credentials for services with names resembling
afs/<I>cell</I>@<I>REALM</I>.  The default is to assume that the cell's
name is the instance in the AFS service's Kerberos principal name.
<P>






















<DT>preauth_options=[]<DD>
controls the preauthentication options which pam_krb5 passes
to libkrb5, if the system-defaults need to be overridden.
The list is treated as a template, and these sequences are
substituted:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%u<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>login&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%U<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>login&nbsp;UID<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%p<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>principal&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%r<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>realm&nbsp;name<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%h<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>home&nbsp;directory<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%d<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>the&nbsp;default&nbsp;ccache&nbsp;directory<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%P<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>the&nbsp;current&nbsp;process&nbsp;ID<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;%%<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>literal&nbsp;'%'<BR>
<P>
<DT>proxiable<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so that credentials it obtains should be proxiable.  This
option is deprecated in favor of the <I>proxiable</I> option in the
<I>libdefaults</I> section of <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+krb5.conf">krb5.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
<DT>pwhelp=<I>filename</I><DD>
specifies the name of a text file whose contents will be displayed to
clients who attempt to change their passwords.  There is no default.
<P>
<DT>realm=<I>realm</I><DD>
overrides the default realm set in <I>/etc/krb5.conf</I>, which pam_krb5.so
will attempt to authenticate users to.
<P>
<DT>renew_lifetime=<I>36000</I><DD>
sets the default renewable lifetime for credentials.  This
option is deprecated in favor of the <I>renew_lifetime</I> option in the
<I>libdefaults</I> section of <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+krb5.conf">krb5.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
<DT>ticket_lifetime=<I>36000</I><DD>
sets the default lifetime for credentials.
<P>
<DT>tokens<DD>
<DT>tokens=<I>imap</I><DD>
signals that pam_krb5.so should create a new AFS PAG and obtain AFS
tokens during authentication in addition to session setup.  This is
primarily useful in server applications which need to access a user's
files but which do not open PAM sessions before doing so.  A
properly-written server will not need this flag set in order to
function correctly.
<P>
<DT>try_first_pass<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to check the previously-entered password as with
<B>use_first_pass</B>, but to prompt the user for another one if the
previously-entered one fails. This is the default mode of operation.
<P>
<DT>use_first_pass<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to get the user's entered password as it was stored by a
module listed earlier in the stack, usually <B>pam_unix</B> or <B>pam_pwdb</B>,
instead of prompting the user for it.
<P>
<DT>use_authtok<DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to never prompt for new passwords when changing passwords.
This is useful if you are using <B>pam_cracklib</B> or <B>pam_passwdqc</B> to try
to enforce use of less-easy-to-guess passwords.
<P>
<DT>use_shmem<DD>
<DT>use_shmem=<I>sshd</I><DD>
tells pam_krb5.so to pass credentials from the authentication service function
to the session management service function using shared memory, or to do so for
specific services.
