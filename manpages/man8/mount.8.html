<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big
tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at
<B>/</B>.

These files can be spread out over several devices. The
<B>mount</B>

command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device
to the big file tree. Conversely, the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+umount">umount</A></B>(8)

command will detach it again.
<P>
The standard form of the
<B>mount</B>

command, is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<BR>

<B>mount -t</B><I> type device dir</I>

<BR>

<P>
</DL>

This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on
<I>device</I>

(which is of type
<I>type</I>)

at the directory
<I>dir</I>.

The previous contents (if any) and owner and mode of
<I>dir</I>

become invisible, and as long as this filesystem remains mounted,
the pathname
<I>dir</I>

refers to the root of the filesystem on
<I>device</I>.

<P>
<B>The listing and help.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Three forms of invocation do not actually mount anything:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>mount -h</B>

<DD>
prints a help message
<DT><B>mount -V</B>

<DD>
prints a version string
<DT><B>mount </B>[<B>-l</B>] [<B>-t </B><I>type</I>]

<DD>
lists all mounted filesystems (of type
<I>type</I>).

The option -l adds the labels in this listing.
See below.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<B>The device indication.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Most devices are indicated by a file name (of a block special device), like
<I>/dev/sda1</I>,

but there are other possibilities. For example, in the case of an NFS mount,
<I>device</I>

may look like
<I>knuth.cwi.nl:/dir</I>.

It is possible to indicate a block special device using its
volume
<B>LABEL</B>

or
<B>UUID</B>

(see the -L and -U options below).
<P>
The recommended setup is to use LABEL=&lt;label&gt; or UUID=&lt;uuid&gt; tags rather than
<B>/dev/disk/by-{label,uuid}</B>

udev symlinks in the /etc/fstab file. The tags are
more readable, robust and portable. The <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+mount">mount</A>(8) command internally uses udev
symlinks, so use the symlinks in /etc/fstab is not advantage over LABEL=/UUID=.
For more details see <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+libblkid">libblkid</A>(3).
<P>
The
<I>proc</I>

filesystem is not associated with a special device, and when
mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as
<I>proc</I>

can be used instead of a device specification.
(The customary choice
<I>none</I>

is less fortunate: the error message `none busy' from
<B>umount</B>

can be confusing.)
</DL>

<P>
<B>The /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts files.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The file
<I>/etc/fstab</I>

(see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+fstab">fstab</A></B>(5)),

may contain lines describing what devices are usually
mounted where, using which options.
<P>

The command
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount -a</B>

[<B>-t</B>

<I>type</I>]

[<B>-O</B>

<I>optlist</I>]

<P>
</DL>

(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in
<I>fstab</I>

(of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options)
to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line contains the
<B>noauto</B>

keyword. Adding the
<B>-F</B>

option will make mount fork, so that the
filesystems are mounted simultaneously.
<P>

When mounting a filesystem mentioned in
<I>fstab</I>

or
<I>mtab</I>,

it suffices to give only the device, or only the mount point.
<P>
<P>
The programs
<B>mount</B>

and
<B>umount</B>

maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file
<I>/etc/mtab</I>.

If no arguments are given to
<B>mount</B>,

this list is printed.
<P>
The
<B>mount</B>

program does not read the
<I>/etc/fstab</I>

file if
<I>device</I>

(or LABEL/UUID) and
<I>dir</I>

are specified. For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount /dev/foo /dir</B>

<P>
</DL>

If you want to override mount options from
<I>/etc/fstab</I>

you have to use:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount device|dir -o &lt;options&gt;</B>

<P>
</DL>

and then the mount options from command line will be appended to
the list of options from
<I>/etc/fstab</I>.

The usual behaviour is that the last option wins if there is more duplicated
options.
<P>
When the
<I>proc</I>

filesystem is mounted (say at
<I>/proc</I>),

the files
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

and
<I>/proc/mounts</I>

have very similar contents. The former has somewhat
more information, such as the mount options used,
but is not necessarily up-to-date (cf. the
<B>-n</B>

option below). It is possible to replace
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

by a symbolic link to
<I>/proc/mounts</I>,

and especially when you have very large numbers of mounts
things will be much faster with that symlink,
but some information is lost that way, and in particular
using the &quot;user&quot; option will fail.
</DL>

<P>
<B>The non-superuser mounts.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Normally, only the superuser can mount filesystems.
However, when
<I>fstab</I>

contains the
<B>user</B>

option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding system.
<P>

Thus, given a line
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide</B>

<P>
</DL>

any user can mount the iso9660 filesystem found on his CDROM
using the command
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount /dev/cdrom</B>

<P>
</DL>

or
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount /cd</B>

<P>
</DL>

For more details, see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+fstab">fstab</A></B>(5).

Only the user that mounted a filesystem can unmount it again.
If any user should be able to unmount, then use
<B>users</B>

instead of
<B>user</B>

in the
<I>fstab</I>

line.
The
<B>owner</B>

option is similar to the
<B>user</B>

option, with the restriction that the user must be the owner
of the special file. This may be useful e.g. for
<I>/dev/fd</I>

if a login script makes the console user owner of this device.
The
<B>group</B>

option is similar, with the restriction that the user must be
member of the group of the special file.
</DL>

<P>
<P>
<B>The bind mounts.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

Since Linux 2.4.0 it is possible to remount part of the
file hierarchy somewhere else. The call is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount --bind</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>

or shortoption
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount -B</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>

or fstab entry is:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<I>/olddir</I>

<I>/newdir</I>

<B>none  bind</B>

</DL>

<P>
After this call the same contents is accessible in two places.
One can also remount a single file (on a single file).
<P>
This call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible
submounts. The entire file hierarchy including submounts is attached
a second place using
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount --rbind</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>

or shortoption
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount -R</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>


<P>
Note that the filesystem mount options will remain the same as those
on the original mount point, and cannot be changed by passing the -o
option along with --bind/--rbind. The mount options can be
changed by a separate remount command, for example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount --bind</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

<BR>

<B>mount -o remount,ro</B>

<I>newdir</I>

</DL>

<P>
</DL>

<P>
<B>The move operation.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Since Linux 2.5.1 it is possible to atomically move a mounted tree
to another place. The call is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount --move</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>

or shortoption
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<BR>

<B>mount -M</B>

<I>olddir newdir</I>

</DL>

This will cause the contents which previously appeared under olddir to be
accessed under newdir.  The physical location of the files is not changed.
</DL>

<P>
<B>The shared subtrees operations.</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Since Linux 2.6.15 it is possible to mark a mount and its submounts as shared,
private, slave or unbindable. A shared mount provides ability to create mirrors
of that mount such that mounts and umounts within any of the mirrors propagate
to the other mirror. A slave mount receives propagation from its master, but
any not vice-versa.  A private mount carries no propagation abilities.  A
unbindable mount is a private mount which cannot cloned through a bind
operation. Detailed semantics is documented in Documentation/sharedsubtree.txt
file in the kernel source tree.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>mount --make-shared </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-slave </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-private </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-unbindable </B><I>mountpoint</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The following commands allows one to recursively change the type of all the
mounts under a given mountpoint.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>mount --make-rshared </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-rslave </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-rprivate </B><I>mountpoint</I>
<B>mount --make-runbindable </B><I>mountpoint</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<P>

<H2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</H2>

The full set of mount options used by an invocation of
<B>mount</B>

is determined by first extracting the
mount options for the filesystem from the
<I>fstab</I>

table, then applying any options specified by the
<B>-o</B>

argument, and finally applying a
<B>-r</B> or <B>-w</B>

option, when present.
<P>
Command line options available for the
<B>mount</B>

command:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-V, --version</B><DD>
Output version.
<DT><B>-h, --help</B><DD>
Print a help message.
<DT><B>-v, --verbose</B><DD>
Verbose mode.
<DT><B>-a, --all</B><DD>
Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in
<I>fstab</I>.

<DT><B>-F, --fork</B><DD>
(Used in conjunction with
<B>-a</B>.)

Fork off a new incarnation of mount for each device.
This will do the mounts on different devices or different NFS servers
in parallel.
This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in
parallel. A disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.
Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both
<I>/usr</I>

and
<I>/usr/spool</I>.

<DT><B>-f, --fake</B><DD>
Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if it's not
obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the filesystem.  This option is useful in
conjunction with the
<B>-v</B>

flag to determine what the
<B>mount</B>

command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries for devices
that were mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f option checks for
existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when the record already
exists (with regular non-fake mount, this check is done by kernel).
<DT><B>-i, --internal-only</B><DD>
Don't call the /sbin/mount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper even if it exists.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
Add the labels in the mount output. Mount must have
permission to read the disk device (e.g. be suid root) for this to work.
One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+e2label">e2label</A></B>(8)

utility, or for XFS using
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+xfs_admin">xfs_admin</A></B>(8),

or for reiserfs using
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+reiserfstune">reiserfstune</A></B>(8).

<DT><B>-n, --no-mtab</B><DD>
Mount without writing in
<I>/etc/mtab</I>.

This is necessary for example when
<I>/etc</I>

is on a read-only filesystem.
<DT><B>--no-canonicalize</B><DD>
Don't canonicalize paths. The mount command canonicalizes all paths 
(from command line or fstab) and stores canonicalized paths to the 
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

file. This option can be used together with the
<B>-f</B>

flag for already canonicalized absolut paths.
<DT><B>-p, --pass-fd </B><I>num</I><DD>
In case of a loop mount with encryption, read the passphrase from
file descriptor
<I>num</I>

instead of from the terminal.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will ignore
mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not all filesystems
support this option. This option exists for support of the Linux
autofs-based automounter.
<DT><B>-r, --read-only</B><DD>
Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is
<B>-o ro</B>.

<P>
Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel behavior, the
system may still write to the device. For example, Ext3 or ext4 will replay its
journal if the filesystem is dirty. To prevent this kind of write access, you
may want to mount ext3 or ext4 filesystem with &quot;ro,noload&quot; mount options or
set the block device to read-only mode, see command
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+blockdev">blockdev</A></B>(8).

<DT><B>-w, --rw</B><DD>
Mount the filesystem read/write. This is the default. A synonym is
<B>-o rw</B>.

<DT><B>-L </B><I>label</I><DD>
Mount the partition that has the specified
<I>label</I>.

<DT><B>-U </B><I>uuid</I><DD>
Mount the partition that has the specified
<I>uuid</I>.

These two options require the file
<I>/proc/partitions</I>

(present since Linux 2.1.116) to exist.
<DT><B>-t, --types </B><I>vfstype</I><DD>
The argument following the
<B>-t</B>

is used to indicate the filesystem type.  The filesystem types which are
currently supported include:
<I>adfs</I>,

<I>affs</I>,

<I>autofs</I>,

<I>cifs</I>,

<I>coda</I>,

<I>coherent</I>,

<I>cramfs</I>,

<I>debugfs</I>,

<I>devpts</I>,

<I>efs</I>,

<I>ext</I>,

<I>ext2</I>,

<I>ext3</I>,

<I>ext4</I>,

<I>hfs</I>,

<I>hfsplus</I>,

<I>hpfs</I>,

<I>iso9660</I>,

<I>jfs</I>,

<I>minix</I>,

<I>msdos</I>,

<I>ncpfs</I>,

<I>nfs</I>,

<I>nfs4</I>,

<I>ntfs</I>,

<I>proc</I>,

<I>qnx4</I>,

<I>ramfs</I>,

<I>reiserfs</I>,

<I>romfs</I>,

<I>squashfs</I>,

<I>smbfs</I>,

<I>sysv</I>,

<I>tmpfs</I>,

<I>ubifs</I>,

<I>udf</I>,

<I>ufs</I>,

<I>umsdos</I>,

<I>usbfs</I>,

<I>vfat</I>,

<I>xenix</I>,

<I>xfs</I>,

<I>xiafs</I>.

Note that coherent, sysv and xenix are equivalent and that
<I>xenix</I>

and
<I>coherent</I>

will be removed at some point in the future --- use
<I>sysv</I>

instead. Since kernel version 2.1.21 the types
<I>ext</I>

and
<I>xiafs</I>

do not exist anymore. Earlier,
<I>usbfs</I>

was known as
<I>usbdevfs</I>.

Note, the real list of all supported filesystems depends on your
kernel.
<P>
The programs
<B>mount</B>

and
<B>umount</B>

support filesystem subtypes.  The subtype is defined by '.subtype' suffix.  For
example  'fuse.sshfs'. It's recommended to use subtype notation rather than add
any prefix to the mount source (for example 'sshfs#example.com' is
depreacated).
<P>
For most types all the
<B>mount</B>

program has to do is issue a simple
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+mount">mount</A></I>(2)

system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem type is required.
For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, ncpfs) ad hoc code is
necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems
have a separate mount program. In order to make it possible to
treat all types in a uniform way, mount will execute the program
<B>/sbin/mount.</B><I>TYPE</I>

(if that exists) when called with type
<I>TYPE</I>.

Since various versions of the
<B>smbmount</B>

program have different calling conventions,
<B>/sbin/mount.smbfs</B>

may have to be a shell script that sets up the desired call.
<P>
If no
<B>-t</B>

option is given, or if the
<B>auto</B>

type is specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
Mount uses the blkid or volume_id library for guessing the filesystem
type; if that does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
mount will try to read the file
<I>/etc/filesystems</I>,

or, if that does not exist,
<I>/proc/filesystems</I>.

All of the filesystem types listed there will be tried,
except for those that are labeled &quot;nodev&quot; (e.g.,
<I>devpts</I>,

<I>proc</I>

and
<I>nfs</I>).

If
<I>/etc/filesystems</I>

ends in a line with a single * only, mount will read
<I>/proc/filesystems</I>

afterwards.
<P>
The
<B>auto</B>

type may be useful for user-mounted floppies.
Creating a file
<I>/etc/filesystems</I>

can be useful to change the probe order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos
or ext3 before ext2) or if you use a kernel module autoloader.
Warning: the probing uses a heuristic (the presence of appropriate `magic'),
and could recognize the wrong filesystem type, possibly with catastrophic
consequences. If your data is valuable, don't ask
<B>mount</B>

to guess.
<P>
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated
list.  The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
<B>no</B>

to specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.
(This can be meaningful with the
<B>-a</B>

option.) For example, the command:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount -a -t nomsdos,ext</B>

<P>
</DL>

mounts all filesystems except those of type
<I>msdos</I>

and
<I>ext</I>.

</DL>

<DT><B>-O, --test-opts </B><I>opts</I><DD>
Used in conjunction with
<B>-a</B>,

to limit the set of filesystems to which the
<B>-a</B>

is applied.  Like
<B>-t</B>

in this regard except that it is useless except in the context of
<B>-a</B>.

For example, the command:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount -a -O no_netdev</B>

<P>
</DL>

mounts all filesystems except those which have the option
<I>_netdev</I>

specified in the options field in the
<I>/etc/fstab</I>

file.
<P>
It is different from
<B>-t</B>

in that each option is matched exactly; a leading
<B>no</B>

at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.
<P>
The
<B>-t</B>

and
<B>-O</B>

options are cumulative in effect; that is, the command
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount -a -t ext2 -O _netdev</B>

<P>
</DL>

mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all filesystems
that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option specified.
</DL>

<DT><B>-o, --options </B><I>opts</I><DD>
Options are specified with a
<B>-o</B>

flag followed by a comma separated string of options. For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
<B>mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nouser</B>

<P>
</DL>

<P>
For more details, see
<B>FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS</B>

and
<B>FILESYSTEM SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS</B>

sections.
</DL>

<DT><B>-B, --bind</B><DD>
Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are available
in both places). See above.
<DT><B>-R, --rbind</B><DD>
Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so that its
contents are available in both places). See above.
<DT><B>-M, --move</B><DD>
Move a subtree to some other place. See above.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS</H2>

Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the
<I>/etc/fstab</I>

file.
<P>
Some of these options could be enabled or disabled by default
in the system kernel. To check the current setting see the options
in /proc/mounts.
<P>
The following options apply to any filesystem that is being
mounted (but not every filesystem actually honors them - e.g., the
<B>sync</B>

option today has effect only for ext2, ext3, fat, vfat and ufs):
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>async</B>

<DD>
All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously. (See also the
<B>sync</B>

option.)
<DT><B>atime</B>

<DD>
Do not use noatime feature, then the inode access time is controlled by kernel
defaults. See also the description for
<B>strictatime</B>

and
<B>reatime</B>

mount options.
<DT><B>noatime</B>

<DD>
Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g, for faster
access on the news spool to speed up news servers).
<DT><B>auto</B>

<DD>
Can be mounted with the
<B>-a</B>

option.
<DT><B>noauto</B>

<DD>
Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the
<B>-a</B>

option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).
<DT><B>context=</B><I>context</I>, <B>fscontext=</B><I>context</I>, <B>defcontext=</B><I>context</I> and <B>rootcontext=</B><I>context</I><DD>
The
<B>context=</B>

option is useful when mounting filesystems that do not support
extended attributes, such as a floppy or hard disk formatted with VFAT, or
systems that are not normally running under SELinux, such as an ext3 formatted
disk from a non-SELinux workstation. You can also use
<B>context=</B>

on filesystems you do not trust, such as a floppy. It also helps in compatibility with
xattr-supporting filesystems on earlier 2.4.&lt;x&gt; kernel versions. Even where
xattrs are supported, you can save time not having to label every file by
assigning the entire disk one security context.
<P>
A commonly used option for removable media is
<B>context=system_u:object_r:removable_t</B>.

<P>
Two other options are
<B>fscontext=</B>

and
<B>defcontext=</B>,

both of which are mutually exclusive of the context option. This means you
can use fscontext and defcontext with each other, but neither can be used with
context.
<P>
The
<B>fscontext=</B>

option works for all filesystems, regardless of their xattr
support. The fscontext option sets the overarching filesystem label to a
specific security context. This filesystem label is separate from the
individual labels on the files. It represents the entire filesystem for
certain kinds of permission checks, such as during mount or file creation.
Individual file labels are still obtained from the xattrs on the files
themselves. The context option actually sets the aggregate context that
fscontext provides, in addition to supplying the same label for individual
files.
<P>
You can set the default security context for unlabeled files using
<B>defcontext=</B>

option. This overrides the value set for unlabeled files in the policy and requires a
filesystem that supports xattr labeling.
<P>
The
<B>rootcontext=</B>

option allows you to explicitly label the root inode of a FS being mounted
before that FS or inode because visable to userspace. This was found to be
useful for things like stateless linux.

<DT><B>defaults</B>

<DD>
Use default options:
<B>rw</B>, <B>suid</B>, <B>dev</B>, <B>exec</B>, <B>auto</B>, <B>nouser</B>, and <B>async.</B>

<DT><B>dev</B>

<DD>
Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.
<DT><B>nodev</B>

<DD>
Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file
system.
<DT><B>diratime</B>

<DD>
Update directory inode access times on this filesystem. This is the default.
<DT><B>nodiratime</B>

<DD>
Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.
<DT><B>dirsync</B>

<DD>
All directory updates within the filesystem should be done synchronously.
This affects the following system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink,
mkdir, rmdir, mknod and rename.
<DT><B>exec</B>

<DD>
Permit execution of binaries.
<DT><B>noexec</B>

<DD>
Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.
(Until recently it was possible to run binaries anyway using a command like
/lib/ld*.so /mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)
<DT><B>group</B>

<DD>
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if one
of his groups matches the group of the device.
This option implies the options
<B>nosuid</B> and <B>nodev</B>

(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
<B>group,dev,suid</B>).

<DT><B>iversion</B>

<DD>
Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be incremented.
<DT><B>noiversion</B>

<DD>
Do not increment the i_version inode field.
<DT><B>mand</B>

<DD>
Allow mandatory locks on this filesystem. See
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+fcntl">fcntl</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>nomand</B>

<DD>
Do not allow mandatory locks on this filesystem.
<DT><B>_netdev</B>

<DD>
The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access
(used to prevent the system from attempting to mount these filesystems
until the network has been enabled on the system).
<DT><B>nofail</B>

<DD>
Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.
<DT><B>relatime</B>

<DD>
Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.  Access
time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the
current modify or change time. (Similar to noatime, but doesn't break
mutt or other applications that need to know if a file has been read
since the last time it was modified.)
<DT><B>norelatime</B>

<DD>
Do not use
<B>relatime</B>

feature. See also the
<B>strictatime</B>

mount option.
<DT><B>strictatime</B>

<DD>
Allows to explicitly requesting full atime updates. This makes it
possible for kernel to defaults to
<B>relatime</B>

or
<B>noatime</B>

but still allow userspace to override it. For more details about the default
system mount options see /proc/mounts.
<DT><B>nostrictatime</B>

<DD>
Use the kernel's default behaviour for inode access time updates.
<DT><B>suid</B>

<DD>
Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
effect.
<DT><B>nosuid</B>

<DD>
Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take
effect. (This seems safe, but is in fact rather unsafe if you have
<A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+suidperl">suidperl</A>(1) installed.)
<DT><B>owner</B>

<DD>
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if he
is the owner of the device.
This option implies the options
<B>nosuid</B> and <B>nodev</B>

(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
<B>owner,dev,suid</B>).

<DT><B>remount</B>

<DD>
Attempt to remount an already-mounted filesystem.  This is commonly
used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a
readonly filesystem writeable. It does not change device or mount point.
<P>
The remount functionality follows the standard way how the mount command works
with options from fstab. It means the mount command doesn't read fstab (or
mtab) only when a
<I>device</I>

and
<I>dir</I>

are fully specified.
<P>
<B>mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir</B>

<P>
After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from
fstab is ignored, except the loop= option which is internally generated and
maintained by the mount command.
<P>
<B>mount -o remount,rw  /dir</B>

<P>
After this call mount reads fstab (or mtab) and merges these options with
options from command line (
<B>-o</B>

).
<DT><B>ro</B>

<DD>
Mount the filesystem read-only.
<DT><B>_rnetdev</B>

<DD>
Like _netdev, except &quot;fsck -a&quot; checks this filesystem during rc.sysinit.
<DT><B>rw</B>

<DD>
Mount the filesystem read-write.
<DT><B>sync</B>

<DD>
All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously. In case of media with limited number of write cycles
(e.g. some flash drives) &quot;sync&quot; may cause life-cycle shortening.
<DT><B>user</B>

<DD>
Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem.
The name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that he can unmount
the filesystem again.
This option implies the options
<B>noexec</B>, <B>nosuid</B>, and <B>nodev</B>

(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
<B>user,exec,dev,suid</B>).

<DT><B>nouser</B>

<DD>
Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem.
This is the default.
<DT><B>users</B>

<DD>
Allow every user to mount and unmount the filesystem.
This option implies the options
<B>noexec</B>, <B>nosuid</B>, and <B>nodev</B>

(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line
<B>users,exec,dev,suid</B>).

<H2>Mount options for devpts</H2>

The devpts filesystem is a pseudo filesystem, traditionally mounted on
<I>/dev/pts</I>.

In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens
<I>/dev/ptmx</I>;

the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process
and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as
<I>/dev/pts/</I>&lt;number&gt;.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>uid=</B><I>value</I> and <B>gid=</B><I>value</I><DD>
This sets the owner or the group of newly created PTYs to
the specified values. When nothing is specified, they will
be set to the UID and GID of the creating process.
For example, if there is a tty group with GID 5, then
<B>gid=5</B>

will cause newly created PTYs to belong to the tty group.
<DT><B>mode=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
Set the mode of newly created PTYs to the specified value.
The default is 0600.
A value of
<B>mode=620</B>

and
<B>gid=5</B>

makes &quot;mesg y&quot; the default on newly created PTYs.
<DT><B>newinstance<DD>
Create a private instance of devpts filesystem, such that
indices of ptys allocated in this new instance are
independent of indices created in other instances of devpts.
<P>
All mounts of devpts without this
newinstance</B>

option share the same set of pty indices (i.e legacy mode).
Each mount of devpts with the
<B>newinstance</B>

option has a private set of pty indices.
<P>
This option is mainly used to support containers in the
linux kernel. It is implemented in linux kernel versions
starting with 2.6.29.  Further, this mount option is valid
only if CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES is enabled in the
kernel configuration.
<P>
To use this option effectively,
<I>/dev/ptmx</I>

must be a symbolic link to
<I>pts/ptmx.</I>

See

<P>
Set the mode for the new
<I>ptmx</I>

device node in the devpts filesystem.
<P>
With the support for multiple instances of devpts (see
<B>newinstance</B>

option above), each instance has a private
<I>ptmx</I>

node in the root of the devpts filesystem (typically
<I>/dev/pts/ptmx).</I>

<P>
For compatibility with older versions of the kernel, the
default mode of the new
<I>ptmx</I>

node is 0000.
<B>ptmxmode=</B><I>value</I>

specifies a more useful mode for the

<B>minixdf</B>

behaviour is to return in the
<I>f_blocks</I>

field the total number of blocks of the filesystem, while the

<DT><B>grpid</B>|<B>bsdgroups</B> and <B>nogrpid</B>|<B>sysvgroups</B>

<DD>
These options define what group id a newly created file gets.
When
<B>grpid</B>

is set, it takes the group id of the directory in which it is created;
otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of the current process, unless
the directory has the setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid
from the parent directory, and also gets the setgid bit set
if it is a directory itself.
<DT><B>grpquota</B>|<B>noquota</B>|<B>quota</B>|<B>usrquota</B>

<DD>
These options are accepted but ignored.
<DT><B>nobh</B>

<DD>
Do not attach buffer_heads to file pagecache. (Since 2.5.49.)
<DT><B>nouid32</B>

<DD>
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability with older
kernels which only store and expect 16-bit values.
<DT><B>oldalloc</B> or <B>orlov</B>

<DD>
Use old allocator or Orlov allocator for new inodes. Orlov is default.
<DT><B>resgid=</B><I>n</I> and <B>resuid=</B><I>n</I><DD>
The ext2 filesystem reserves a certain percentage of the available
space (by default 5%, see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+mke2fs">mke2fs</A></B>(8)

and
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+tune2fs">tune2fs</A></B>(8)).

These options determine who can use the reserved blocks.
(Roughly: whoever has the specified uid, or belongs to the specified group.)
<DT><B>sb=</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Instead of block 1, use block
<I>n</I>

as superblock. This could be useful when the filesystem has been damaged.
(Earlier, copies of the superblock would be made every 8192 blocks: in
block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands of copies on
a big filesystem). Since version 1.08,
<B>mke2fs</B>

has a -s (sparse superblock) option to reduce the number of backup
superblocks, and since version 1.15 this is the default. Note
that this may mean that ext2 filesystems created by a recent
<B>mke2fs</B>

cannot be mounted r/w under Linux 2.0.*.)
The block number here uses 1k units. Thus, if you want to use logical
block 32768 on a filesystem with 4k blocks, use &quot;sb=131072&quot;.

<H2>Mount options for ext3</H2>

The ext3 filesystem is a version of the ext2 filesystem which has been
enhanced with journalling.  It supports the same options as ext2 as
well as the following additions:



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>journal=update</B>

<DD>
Update the ext3 filesystem's journal to the current format.
<DT><B>journal=inum</B>

<DD>
When a journal already exists, this option is ignored. Otherwise, it
specifies the number of the inode which will represent the ext3 filesystem's
journal file;  ext3 will create a new journal, overwriting the old contents
of the file whose inode number is
<I>inum</I>.

<DT><B>journal_dev=devnum</B>

<DD>
When the external journal device's major/minor numbers
have changed, this option allows the user to specify
the new journal location.  The journal device is
identified through its new major/minor numbers encoded
in devnum.
<DT><B>norecovery</B>/<B>noload</B>

<DD>
Don't load the journal on mounting.  Note that
if the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly,
skipping the journal replay will lead to the
filesystem containing inconsistencies that can
lead to any number of problems.
<DT><B>data=</B>{<B>journal</B>|<B>ordered</B>|<B>writeback</B>}

<DD>
Specifies the journalling mode for file data.  Metadata is always journaled.
To use modes other than
<B>ordered</B>

on the root filesystem, pass the mode to the kernel as boot parameter, e.g.
<I>rootflags=data=journal</I>.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>journal</B>

<DD>
All data is committed into the journal prior to being written into the
main filesystem.
<DT><B>ordered</B>

<DD>
This is the default mode.  All data is forced directly out to the main file
system prior to its metadata being committed to the journal.
<DT><B>writeback</B>

<DD>
Data ordering is not preserved - data may be written into the main
filesystem after its metadata has been committed to the journal.
This is rumoured to be the highest-throughput option.  It guarantees
internal filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data to appear
in files after a crash and journal recovery.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>barrier=0</B> / <B>barrier=1</B>

<DD>
This enables/disables barriers.  barrier=0 disables it, barrier=1 enables it.
Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making
volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty.  The ext3
filesystem does not enable write barriers by default.  Be sure to enable
barriers unless your disks are battery-backed one way or another.  Otherwise
you risk filesystem corruption in case of power failure.
<DT><B>commit=</B><I>nrsec</I>

<DD>
Sync all data and metadata every
<I>nrsec</I>

seconds. The default value is 5 seconds. Zero means default.
<DT><B>user_xattr</B>

<DD>
Enable Extended User Attributes. See the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+attr">attr</A></B>(5)

manual page.
<DT><B>acl</B>

<B>sysvgroups, resgid, resuid, sb, quota, noquota, grpquota, usrquota</B>

and
<B>[no]bh</B>

are backwardly compatible with ext3 or ext2.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>journal_checksum</B>

<DD>
Enable checksumming of the journal transactions.  This will allow the recovery
code in e2fsck and the kernel to detect corruption in the kernel.  It is a
compatible change and will be ignored by older kernels.
<DT><B>journal_async_commit</B>

<DD>
Commit block can be written to disk without waiting for descriptor blocks. If
enabled older kernels cannot mount the device. This will enable

<DT><B>journal=update</B>

<DD>
Update the ext4 filesystem's journal to the current format.
<DT><B>barrier=0</B> / <B>barrier=1</B> / <B>barrier</B> / <B>nobarrier</B>

<DD>
This enables/disables the use of write barriers in the jbd code.  barrier=0
disables, barrier=1 enables.  This also requires an IO stack which can support
barriers, and if jbd gets an error on a barrier write, it will disable again
with a warning.  Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal
commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to use, at some performance
penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in one way or another, disabling
barriers may safely improve performance.  The mount options &quot;barrier&quot; and
&quot;nobarrier&quot; can also be used to enable or disable barriers, for consistency
with other ext4 mount options.
<P>
The ext4 filesystem enables write barriers by default.
<DT><B>inode_readahead=</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This tuning parameter controls the maximum number of inode table blocks that
ext4's inode table readahead algorithm will pre-read into the buffer cache.
The default value is 32 blocks.
<DT><B>stripe=</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Number of filesystem blocks that mballoc will try to use for allocation size
and alignment. For RAID5/6 systems this should be the number of data disks *
RAID chunk size in filesystem blocks.
<DT><B>delalloc</B>

<DD>
Deferring block allocation until write-out time.
<DT><B>nodelalloc</B>

<DD>
Disable delayed allocation. Blocks are allocation when data is copied from user
to page cache.
<DT><B>max_batch_time=</B><I>usec</I>

<DD>
Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional filesystem operations to
be batch together with a synchronous write operation. Since a synchronous
write operation is going to force a commit and then a wait for the I/O
complete, it doesn't cost much, and can be a huge throughput win, we wait for a
small amount of time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the
synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to automatically tune for
the speed of the disk, by measuring the amount of time (on average) that it
takes to finish committing a transaction. Call this time the &quot;commit time&quot;.
If the time that the transactoin has been running is less than the commit time,
ext4 will try sleeping for the commit time to see if other operations will join
the transaction. The commit time is capped by the max_batch_time, which
defaults to 15000us (15ms). This optimization can be turned off entirely by
setting max_batch_time to 0.
<DT><B>min_batch_time=</B><I>usec</I>

<DD>
This parameter sets the commit time (as described above) to be at least
min_batch_time. It defaults to zero microseconds. Increasing this parameter
may improve the throughput of multi-threaded, synchronous workloads on very
fast disks, at the cost of increasing latency.
<DT><B>journal_ioprio=</B><I>prio</I>

<DD>
The I/O priority (from 0 to 7, where 0 is the highest priorty) which should be
used for I/O operations submitted by kjournald2 during a commit operation.
This defaults to 3, which is a slightly higher priority than the default I/O
priority.
<DT><B>abort</B>

<DD>
Simulate the effects of calling ext4_abort() for
debugging purposes.  This is normally used while
remounting a filesystem which is already mounted.
<DT><B>auto_da_alloc</B>|<B>noauto_da_alloc</B>

<DD>
Many broken applications don't use fsync() when noauto_da_alloc
replacing existing files via patterns such as
<P>
fd = open(&quot;foo.new&quot;)/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/ rename(&quot;foo.new&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)
<P>
or worse yet
<P>
fd = open(&quot;foo&quot;, O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).
<P>
If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the replace-via-rename and
replace-via-truncate patterns and force that any delayed allocation blocks are
allocated such that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk before the rename()
operation is commited.  This provides roughly the same level of guarantees as
ext3, and avoids the &quot;zero-length&quot; problem that can happen when a system
crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are forced to disk.
<DT><B>discard</B>/<B>nodiscard</B>

<DD>
Controls whether ext4 should issue discard/TRIM commands to the underlying
block device when blocks are freed.  This is useful for SSD devices and
sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs, but it is off by default until sufficient
testing has been done.
<DT><B>nouid32</B>

<DD>
Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for
interoperability  with  older kernels which only
store and expect 16-bit values.
<DT><B>resize</B>

<DD>
Allows to resize filesystem to the end of the last
existing block group, further resize has to be done
with resize2fs either online, or offline. It can be
used only with conjunction with remount.
<DT><B>block_validity</B>/<B>noblock_validity</B>

<DD>
This options allows to enables/disables the in-kernel facility for tracking
filesystem metadata blocks within internal data structures. This allows multi-
block allocator and other routines to quickly locate extents which might
overlap with filesystem metadata blocks. This option is intended for debugging
purposes and since it negatively affects the performance, it is off by default.
<DT><B>dioread_lock</B>/<B>dioread_nolock</B>

<DD>
Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read locking. If the
dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will allocate uninitialized extent
before buffer write and convert the extent to initialized after IO completes.
This approach allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex, which improves
scalability on high speed storages. However this does not work with nobh option
and the mount will fail. Nor does it work with data journaling and
dioread_nolock option will be ignored with kernel warning. Note that
dioread_nolock code path is only used for extent-based files.  Because of the
restrictions this options comprises it is off by default (e.g. dioread_lock).
<DT><B>i_version</B>

<DD>
Enable 64-bit inode version support. This option is off by default.

<P>
Normally
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+utime">utime</A>(2)</B>

checks current process is owner of the file, or it has
CAP_FOWNER capability.  But FAT filesystem doesn't have uid/gid on disk, so
normal check is too unflexible. With this option you can relax it.

Several people have had their data ruined by this translation. Beware!
<P>
For filesystems mounted in binary mode, a conversion tool

</DL>

<DT><B>cvf_format=</B><I>module</I>

<DD>
Forces the driver to use the CVF (Compressed Volume File) module
cvf_<I>module</I>

instead of auto-detection. If the kernel supports kmod, the
cvf_format=xxx option also controls on-demand CVF module loading.
This option is obsolete.
<DT><B>cvf_option=</B><I>option</I>

<DD>
Option passed to the CVF module. This option is obsolete.
<DT><B>debug</B>

<DD>
Turn on the

inconsistent).
<DT><B>fat=</B>{12<B>|</B>16<B>|</B>32<B>}</B>

<DD>
Specify a 12, 16 or 32 bit fat.  This overrides
the automatic FAT type detection routine.  Use with caution!
<DT><B>iocharset=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters
and 16 bit Unicode characters. The default is iso8859-1.
Long filenames are stored on disk in Unicode format.
<DT><B>tz=UTC</B>

<DD>
This option disables the conversion of timestamps
between local time (as used by Windows on FAT) and UTC
(which Linux uses internally).  This is particularly
useful when mounting devices (like digital cameras)
that are set to UTC in order to avoid the pitfalls of
local time.
<DT><B>quiet</B>

<DD>
Turn on the
<I>quiet</I>

although they fail. Use with caution!
<DT><B>showexec</B>

If set, the execute permission bits of the file will be allowed only if
the extension part of the name is .EXE, .COM, or .BAT. Not set by default.
<DT><B>sys_immutable</B>

If set, ATTR_SYS attribute on FAT is handled as IMMUTABLE flag on Linux.
Not set by default.
<DT><B>flush</B>

<DD>
If set, the filesystem will try to flush to disk more early than normal.
Not set by default.
<DT><B>usefree</B>

<DD>
Use the &quot;free clusters&quot; value stored on FSINFO. It'll
be used to determine number of free clusters without
scanning disk. But it's not used by default, because
recent Windows don't update it correctly in some

<H2>Mount options for iso9660</H2>

ISO 9660 is a standard describing a filesystem structure to be used
on CD-ROMs. (This filesystem type is also seen on some DVDs. See also the
<I>udf</I>

filesystem.)
<P>
Normal
<I>iso9660</I>

filenames appear in a 8.3 format (i.e., DOS-like restrictions on filename
length), and in addition all characters are in upper case.  Also there is
no field for file ownership, protection, number of links, provision for
block/character devices, etc.
<P>
Rock Ridge is an extension to iso9660 that provides all of these unix like
features.  Basically there are extensions to each directory record that
supply all of the additional information, and when Rock Ridge is in use,
the filesystem is indistinguishable from a normal UNIX filesystem (except
that it is read-only, of course).
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>check=</B>{<B>r</B>[<B>elaxed</B>]|<B>s</B>[<B>trict</B>]}

With
<B>check=relaxed</B>,

a filename is first converted to lower case before doing the lookup.
This is probably only meaningful together with
<B>norock</B>

<B>map=normal</B>.

(Default:

<DT><B>uid=</B><I>value</I> and <B>gid=</B><I>value</I><DD>

<DT><B>map=</B>{<B>n</B>[<B>ormal</B>]|<B>o</B>[<B>ff</B>]|<B>a</B>[<B>corn</B>]}

<DD>
For non-Rock Ridge volumes, normal name translation maps upper
to lower case ASCII, drops a trailing `;1', and converts `;' to `.'.
With
<B>map=off</B>

no name translation is done. See
<B>norock</B>.

(Default:
<B>map=normal</B>.)

<B>map=acorn</B>

is like
<B>map=normal</B>

but also apply Acorn extensions if present.
<DT><B>mode=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
For non-Rock Ridge volumes, give all files the indicated mode.
(Default: read permission for everybody.)
Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs to specify the mode in
decimal. (Octal is indicated by a leading 0.)
<DT><B>unhide</B>

<DD>
Also show hidden and associated files.

the same filenames, this may make the ordinary files inaccessible.)
<DT><B>block=</B>{<B>512</B>|<B>1024</B>|<B>2048</B>}

<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+LILO">LILO</A></B>(8).

This option is used to disable packing of files into the tree.
<DT><B>replayonly</B>

<DD>
Replay the transactions which are in the journal, but do not actually
mount the filesystem. Mainly used by
<I>reiserfsck</I>.

<DT><B>resize=</B><I>number</I>

<DD>
A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs partitions.
Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has
<I>number</I>

blocks.
This option is designed for use with devices which are under logical
volume management (LVM).
There is a special
<I>resizer</I>

utility which can be obtained from
<I><A HREF="ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs">ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs</A></I>.

<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+acl">acl</A></B>(5)

<DT><B>barrier=none</B> / <B>barrier=flush</B>

<DD>
This enables/disables the use of write barriers in the journaling code.
barrier=none disables it, barrier=flush enables it. Write barriers enforce
proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches
safe to use, at some performance penalty. The reiserfs filesystem does not
enable write barriers by default. Be sure to enable barriers unless your disks
are battery-backed one way or another. Otherwise you risk filesystem
corruption in case of power failure.

<DD>
Override default maximum size of the filesystem.
The size is given in bytes, and rounded up to entire pages.
The default is half of the memory. The size parameter also accepts a suffix %
to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM:
the default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%
<DT><B>nr_blocks=</B>

<DD>
The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
<DT><B>nr_inodes=</B>

The NodeList format is a comma-separated list of decimal numbers and ranges, a
range being two hyphen-separated decimal numbers, the smallest and largest node
numbers in the range.  For example, mpol=bind:0-3,5,7,9-15
<P>
Note that trying to mount a tmpfs with an mpol option will fail if the
running kernel does not support NUMA; and will fail if its nodelist
specifies a node which is not online.  If your system relies on that
tmpfs being mounted, but from time to time runs a kernel built without
NUMA capability (perhaps a safe recovery kernel), or with fewer nodes
online, then it is advisable to omit the mpol option from automatic
mount options.  It can be added later, when the tmpfs is already mounted
on MountPoint, by 'mount -o remount,mpol=Policy:NodeList MountPoint'.

<DT>The following mount options are available:<DD>
<DT><B>bulk_read</B>

<DD>
Enable bulk-read. VFS read-ahead is disabled because it slows down the file
system. Bulk-Read is an internal optimization. Some flashes may read faster if
the data are read at one go, rather than at several read requests. For
example, OneNAND can do &quot;read-while-load&quot; if it reads more than one NAND page.
<DT><B>no_bulk_read</B>

<DD>
Do not bulk-read. This is the default.
<DT><B>chk_data_crc</B>

<DD>
Check data CRC-32 checksums. This is the default.
<DT><B>no_chk_data_crc.</B>

<DD>
Do not check data CRC-32 checksums. With this option, the filesystem does not
check CRC-32 checksum for data, but it does check it for the internal indexing
information. This option only affects reading, not writing. CRC-32 is always
calculated when writing the data.

<H2>Mount options for ufs</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ufstype=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
UFS is a filesystem widely used in different operating systems.
The problem are differences among implementations. Features of some
implementations are undocumented, so its hard to recognize the
type of ufs automatically.
That's why the user must specify the type of ufs by mount option.
Possible values are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>old</B>

<DD>
Old format of ufs, this is the default, read only.
(Don't forget to give the -r option.)

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>uni_xlate</B>

<DD>
Translate unhandled Unicode characters to special escaped sequences.
This lets you backup and restore filenames that are created with any
Unicode characters. Without this option, a '?' is used when no
translation is possible. The escape character is ':' because it is
otherwise illegal on the vfat filesystem. The escape sequence
that gets used, where u is the unicode character,
is: ':', (u &amp; 0x3f), ((u&gt;&gt;6) &amp; 0x3f), (u&gt;&gt;12).
<DT><B>posix</B>

<DT><B>nonumtail</B>

<DD>

<DT><B>utf8</B>

<DD>
UTF8 is the filesystem safe 8-bit encoding of Unicode that is used by the
console. It can be be enabled for the filesystem with this option or disabled
with utf8=0, utf8=no or utf8=false. If `uni_xlate' gets set, UTF8 gets
disabled.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>allocsize=</B><I>size</I>

<DD>
Sets the buffered I/O end-of-file preallocation size when
doing delayed allocation writeout (default size is 64KiB).
Valid values for this option are page size (typically 4KiB)
through to 1GiB, inclusive, in power-of-2 increments.
<DT><B>attr2</B>|<B>noattr2</B>

<DD>
The options enable/disable (default is enabled) an &quot;opportunistic&quot;
improvement to be made in the way inline extended attributes are
stored on-disk.
When the new form is used for the first time (by setting or
removing extended attributes) the on-disk superblock feature
bit field will be updated to reflect this format being in use.
<DT><B>barrier</B>

<DD>
Enables the use of block layer write barriers for writes into
the journal and unwritten extent conversion.  This allows for
drive level write caching to be enabled, for devices that
support write barriers.
<DT><B>dmapi</B>

<DD>
Enable the DMAPI (Data Management API) event callouts.
Use with the
<B>mtpt</B>

option.
<DT><B>grpid</B>|<B>bsdgroups</B> and <B>nogrpid</B>|<B>sysvgroups</B>

<DD>
These options define what group ID a newly created file gets.
When grpid is set, it takes the group ID of the directory in
which it is created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid
of the current process, unless the directory has the setgid bit
set, in which case it takes the gid from the parent directory,
and also gets the setgid bit set if it is a directory itself.
<DT><B>ihashsize=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
Sets the number of hash buckets available for hashing the
in-memory inodes of the specified mount point.  If a value
of zero is used, the value selected by the default algorithm
will be displayed in
<I>/proc/mounts</I>.

<DT><B>ikeep</B>|<B>noikeep</B>

<DD>
When inode clusters are emptied of inodes, keep them around
on the disk (ikeep) - this is the traditional XFS behaviour
and is still the default for now.  Using the noikeep option,
inode clusters are returned to the free space pool.
<DT><B>inode64</B>

<DD>
Indicates that XFS is allowed to create inodes at any location
in the filesystem, including those which will result in inode
numbers occupying more than 32 bits of significance.  This is
provided for backwards compatibility, but causes problems for
backup applications that cannot handle large inode numbers.
<DT><B>largeio</B>|<B>nolargeio</B>

<DD>
If
<B>nolargeio</B>

is specified, the optimal I/O reported in
st_blksize by
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+stat">stat</A></B>(2)

will be as small as possible to allow user
applications to avoid inefficient read/modify/write I/O.
If
<B>largeio</B>

is specified, a filesystem that has a
<B>swidth</B>

specified
will return the
<B>swidth</B>

value (in bytes) in st_blksize. If the
filesystem does not have a
<B>swidth</B>

specified but does specify
an
<B>allocsize</B>

then
<B>allocsize</B>

(in bytes) will be returned
instead.
If neither of these two options are specified, then filesystem
will behave as if
<B>nolargeio</B>

was specified.
<DT><B>logbufs=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
Set the number of in-memory log buffers.  Valid numbers range
from 2-8 inclusive.
The default value is 8 buffers for filesystems with a
blocksize of 64KiB, 4 buffers for filesystems with a blocksize
of 32KiB, 3 buffers for filesystems with a blocksize of 16KiB
and 2 buffers for all other configurations.  Increasing the
number of buffers may increase performance on some workloads
at the cost of the memory used for the additional log buffers
and their associated control structures.
<DT><B>logbsize=</B><I>value</I>

<DD>
Set the size of each in-memory log buffer.
Size may be specified in bytes, or in kilobytes with a &quot;k&quot; suffix.
Valid sizes for version 1 and version 2 logs are 16384 (16k) and
32768 (32k).  Valid sizes for version 2 logs also include
65536 (64k), 131072 (128k) and 262144 (256k).
The default value for machines with more than 32MiB of memory
is 32768, machines with less memory use 16384 by default.
<DT><B>logdev=</B><I>device</I> and <B>rtdev=</B><I>device</I><DD>
Use an external log (metadata journal) and/or real-time device.
An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a data section, a log section,
and a real-time section.
The real-time section is optional, and the log section can be separate
from the data section or contained within it.
Refer to
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+xfs">xfs</A></B>(5).

<DT><B>mtpt=</B><I>mountpoint</I>

<DD>
Use with the
<B>dmapi</B>

option. The value specified here will be
included in the DMAPI mount event, and should be the path of
the actual mountpoint that is used.
<DT><B>noalign</B>

<DD>
Data allocations will not be aligned at stripe unit boundaries.
<DT><B>noatime</B>

<DD>
Access timestamps are not updated when a file is read.
<DT><B>norecovery</B>

<DD>
The filesystem will be mounted without running log recovery.
If the filesystem was not cleanly unmounted, it is likely to
be inconsistent when mounted in
<B>norecovery</B>

mode.
Some files or directories may not be accessible because of this.
Filesystems mounted
<B>norecovery</B>

must be mounted read-only or the mount will fail.
<DT><B>nouuid</B>

<DD>
Don't check for double mounted filesystems using the filesystem uuid.
This is useful to mount LVM snapshot volumes.
<DT><B>osyncisosync</B>

<DD>
Make O_SYNC writes implement true O_SYNC.  WITHOUT this option,
Linux XFS behaves as if an
<B>osyncisdsync</B>

option is used,
which will make writes to files opened with the O_SYNC flag set
behave as if the O_DSYNC flag had been used instead.
This can result in better performance without compromising
data safety.
However if this option is not in effect, timestamp updates from
O_SYNC writes can be lost if the system crashes.
If timestamp updates are critical, use the
<B>osyncisosync</B>

option.
<DT><B>uquota</B>|<B>usrquota</B>|<B>uqnoenforce</B>|<B>quota</B>

<DT><B>sunit=</B><I>value</I> and <B>swidth=</B><I>value</I><DD>
Used to specify the stripe unit and width for a RAID device or a stripe
volume.
<I>value</I>

must be specified in 512-byte block units.
If this option is not specified and the filesystem was made on a stripe
volume or the stripe width or unit were specified for the RAID device at
mkfs time, then the mount system call will restore the value from the
superblock.
For filesystems that are made directly on RAID devices, these options can be
used to override the information in the superblock if the underlying disk
layout changes after the filesystem has been created.
The
<B>swidth</B>

option is required if the
<B>sunit</B>

option has been specified,
and must be a multiple of the
<B>sunit</B>

value.
<DT><B>swalloc</B>

<H2>THE LOOP DEVICE</H2>

One further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For example,
the command
<P>
<PRE>
<B>  mount /tmp/fdimage /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop3</B>
</PRE>

<P>
will set up the loop device
<I>/dev/loop3</I>

to correspond to the file
<I>/tmp/fdimage</I>,

and then mount this device on
<I>/mnt</I>.

<P>
This type of mount knows about four options, namely
<B>loop</B>, <B>offset</B>, <B>sizelimit</B> and <B>encryption</B>,

that are really options to
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+losetup">losetup</A></B>(8).

(These options can be used in addition to those specific

<P>
If no explicit loop device is mentioned

<B>mount</B>

will try to find some unused loop device and use that.
<P>
Since Linux 2.6.25 is supported auto-destruction of loop devices and
then any loop device allocated by
<B>mount</B>

will be freed by
<B>umount</B>

independently on

You can also free a loop device by hand, using `losetup -d' or `umount -d`.

[<B>-sfnv</B>]

[<B>-o</B>

<P>
where the &lt;type&gt; is filesystem type and -sfnvo options have same meaning like
standard mount options. The -t option is used  for filesystems with subtypes
support (for example /sbin/mount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs).

<H2>BUGS</H2>

It is possible for a corrupted filesystem to cause a crash.
<P>

Some Linux filesystems don't support
<B>-o sync and -o dirsync</B>

(the ext2, ext3, fat and vfat filesystems
<I>do</I>

support synchronous updates (a la BSD) when mounted with the
<B>sync</B>

option).
<P>

The
<B>-o remount</B>

may not be able to change mount parameters (all
<I>ext2fs</I>-specific

parameters, except
<B>sb</B>,

are changeable with a remount, for example, but you can't change
<B>gid</B>

or
<B>umask</B>

for the
<I>fatfs</I>).

<P>

Mount by label or uuid will work only if your devices have the names listed in
<I>/proc/partitions</I>.

In particular, it may well fail if the kernel was compiled with devfs
but devfs is not mounted.
<P>

It is possible that files
<I>/etc/mtab</I>

and
<I>/proc/mounts</I>

don't match. The first file is based only on the mount command options, but the
content of the second file also depends on the kernel and others settings (e.g.
remote NFS server. In particular case the mount command may reports unreliable
information about a NFS mount point and the /proc/mounts file usually contains
more reliable information.)
<P>

Checking files on NFS filesystem referenced by file descriptors (i.e. the
<B>fcntl</B>

and
<B>ioctl</B>

families of functions) may lead to inconsistent result due to the lack of
consistency check in kernel even if noac is used.
