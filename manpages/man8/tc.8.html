<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Tc</B>

is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. Traffic Control consists 
of the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SHAPING<DD>
When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under control. Shaping may 
be more than lowering the available bandwidth - it is also used to smooth out 
bursts in traffic for better network behaviour. Shaping occurs on egress.
<P>
<DT>SCHEDULING<DD>
By scheduling the transmission of packets it is possible to improve interactivity
for traffic that needs it while still guaranteeing bandwidth to bulk transfers. Reordering
is also called prioritizing, and happens only on egress.
<P>
<DT>POLICING<DD>
Where shaping deals with transmission of traffic, policing pertains to traffic
arriving. Policing thus occurs on ingress.
<P>
<DT>DROPPING<DD>
Traffic exceeding a set bandwidth may also be dropped forthwith, both on 
ingress and on egress.
<P>

Processing of traffic is controlled by three kinds of objects: qdiscs, 
classes and filters. 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>QDISCS</H2>

<B>qdisc </B>

is short for 'queueing discipline' and it is elementary to 
understanding traffic control. Whenever the kernel needs to send a 
packet to an interface, it is 
<B>enqueued</B>

to the qdisc configured for that interface. Immediately afterwards, the kernel
tries to get as many packets as possible from the qdisc, for giving them
to the network adaptor driver.
<P>
A simple QDISC is the 'pfifo' one, which does no processing at all and is a pure 
First In, First Out queue. It does however store traffic when the network interface
can't handle it momentarily.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CLASSES</H2>

Some qdiscs can contain classes, which contain further qdiscs - traffic may 
then be enqueued in any of the inner qdiscs, which are within the
<B>classes.</B>

When the kernel tries to dequeue a packet from such a 
<B>classful qdisc</B>

it can come from any of the classes. A qdisc may for example prioritize 
certain kinds of traffic by trying to dequeue from certain classes
before others.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILTERS</H2>

A
<B>filter</B>

is used by a classful qdisc to determine in which class a packet will
be enqueued. Whenever traffic arrives at a class with subclasses, it needs
to be classified. Various methods may be employed to do so, one of these
are the filters. All filters attached to the class are called, until one of 
them returns with a verdict. If no verdict was made, other criteria may be 
available. This differs per qdisc.
<P>
It is important to notice that filters reside 
<B>within</B>

qdiscs - they are not masters of what happens.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CLASSLESS QDISCS</H2>

The classless qdiscs are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>[p|b]fifo<DD>
Simplest usable qdisc, pure First In, First Out behaviour. Limited in 
packets or in bytes.
<DT>pfifo_fast<DD>
Standard qdisc for 'Advanced Router' enabled kernels. Consists of a three-band
queue which honors Type of Service flags, as well as the priority that may be 
assigned to a packet.
<DT>red<DD>
Random Early Detection simulates physical congestion by randomly dropping
packets when nearing configured bandwidth allocation. Well suited to very
large bandwidth applications.
<DT>sfq<DD>
Stochastic Fairness Queueing reorders queued traffic so each 'session'
gets to send a packet in turn.
<DT>tbf<DD>
The Token Bucket Filter is suited for slowing traffic down to a precisely
configured rate. Scales well to large bandwidths. 
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURING CLASSLESS QDISCS</H2>

In the absence of classful qdiscs, classless qdiscs can only be attached at 
the root of a device. Full syntax:

<B>tc qdisc add dev </B>

DEV 
<B>root </B>

QDISC QDISC-PARAMETERS
<P>
To remove, issue

<B>tc qdisc del dev</B>

DEV
<B>root</B>

<P>
The  
<B>pfifo_fast</B>

qdisc is the automatic default in the absence of a configured qdisc.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CLASSFUL QDISCS</H2>

The classful qdiscs are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CBQ<DD>
Class Based Queueing implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of classes. 
It contains shaping elements as well as prioritizing capabilities. Shaping is
performed using link idle time calculations based on average packet size and
underlying link bandwidth. The latter may be ill-defined for some interfaces.
<DT>HTB<DD>
The Hierarchy Token Bucket implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of 
classes with an emphasis on conforming to existing practices. HTB facilitates
guaranteeing bandwidth to classes, while also allowing specification of upper
limits to inter-class sharing. It contains shaping elements, based on TBF and
can prioritize classes.<TT>&nbsp;</TT><BR>
<DT>PRIO<DD>
The PRIO qdisc is a non-shaping container for a configurable number of 
classes which are dequeued in order. This allows for easy prioritization 
of traffic, where lower classes are only able to send if higher ones have 
no packets available. To facilitate configuration, Type Of Service bits are 
honored by default.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THEORY OF OPERATION</H2>

Classes form a tree, where each class has a single parent. 
A class may have multiple children. Some qdiscs allow for runtime addition
of classes (CBQ, HTB) while others (PRIO) are created with a static number of 
children.
<P>
Qdiscs which allow dynamic addition of classes can have zero or more 
subclasses to which traffic may be enqueued. 
<P>
Furthermore, each class contains a
<B>leaf qdisc</B>

which by default has 
<B>pfifo </B>

behaviour though another qdisc can be attached in place. This qdisc may again 
contain classes, but each class can have only one leaf qdisc. 
<P>
When a packet enters a classful qdisc it can be 
<B>classified</B>

to one of the classes within. Three criteria are available, although not all 
qdiscs will use all three:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>tc filters<DD>
If tc filters are attached to a class, they are consulted first 
for relevant instructions. Filters can match on all fields of a packet header, 
as well as on the firewall mark applied by ipchains or iptables. 
<DT>Type of Service<DD>
Some qdiscs have built in rules for classifying packets based on the TOS field.
<DT>skb-&gt;priority<DD>
Userspace programs can encode a class-id in the 'skb-&gt;priority' field using 
the SO_PRIORITY option.

Each node within the tree can have its own filters but higher level filters
may also point directly to lower classes.
<P>
If classification did not succeed, packets are enqueued to the leaf qdisc 
attached to that class. Check qdisc specific manpages for details, however.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAMING</H2>

All qdiscs, classes and filters have IDs, which can either be specified
or be automatically assigned. 
<P>
IDs consist of a major number and a minor number, separated by a colon.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>QDISCS<DD>
A qdisc, which potentially can have children, 
gets assigned a major number, called a 'handle', leaving the minor 
number namespace available for classes. The handle is expressed as '10:'. 
It is customary to explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs expected to have 
children.
<P>
<DT>CLASSES<DD>
Classes residing under a qdisc share their qdisc major number, but each have
a separate minor number called a 'classid' that has no relation to their 
parent classes, only to their parent qdisc. The same naming custom as for 
qdiscs applies.
<P>
<DT>FILTERS<DD>
Filters have a three part ID, which is only needed when using a hashed
filter hierarchy.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UNITS</H2>

All parameters accept a floating point number, possibly followed by a unit.

Bandwidths or rates can be specified in:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>kbps<DD>
Kilobytes per second
<DT>mbps<DD>
Megabytes per second
<DT>kbit<DD>
Kilobits per second
<DT>mbit<DD>
Megabits per second
<DT>bps or a bare number<DD>
Bytes per second

Amounts of data can be specified in:
<DT>kb or k<DD>
Kilobytes
<DT>mb or m<DD>
Megabytes
<DT>mbit<DD>
Megabits
<DT>kbit<DD>
Kilobits
<DT>b or a bare number<DD>
Bytes.

Lengths of time can be specified in:
<DT>s, sec or secs<DD>
Whole seconds
<DT>ms, msec or msecs<DD>
Milliseconds
<DT>us, usec, usecs or a bare number<DD>
Microseconds.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TC COMMANDS</H2>

The following commands are available for qdiscs, classes and filter:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>add<DD>
Add a qdisc, class or filter to a node. For all entities, a 
<B>parent</B>

must be passed, either by passing its ID or by attaching directly to the root of a device. 
When creating a qdisc or a filter, it can be named with the
<B>handle</B>

parameter. A class is named with the
<B>classid</B>

parameter.
<P>
<DT>remove<DD>
A qdisc can be removed by specifying its handle, which may also be 'root'. All subclasses and their leaf qdiscs 
are automatically deleted, as well as any filters attached to them.
<P>
<DT>change<DD>
Some entities can be modified 'in place'. Shares the syntax of 'add', with the exception
that the handle cannot be changed and neither can the parent. In other words, 
<B>change </B>

cannot move a node.
<P>
<DT>replace<DD>
Performs a nearly atomic remove/add on an existing node id. If the node does not exist yet
it is created.
<P>
<DT>link<DD>
Only available for qdiscs and performs a replace where the node 
must exist already.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FORMAT</H2>

The show command has additional formatting options:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-s</B>,<B> -stats,</B> -statistics

<DD>
output more statistics about packet usage.
<P>
<DT><B>-d,</B> -details

<DD>
output more detailed information about rates and cell sizes.
<P>
<DT><B>-r,</B> -raw

<DD>
output raw hex values for handles.
<P>
<DT><B>-p,</B> -pretty

<DD>
decode filter offset and mask values to equivalent filter commands based on TCP/IP.
<P>
<DT><B>-iec</B>

<DD>
