PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux
<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to
<B>Linux-PAM</B>. For more information the reader is directed to the
<B>Linux-PAM system administrators' guide</B>.
<P>

<P>
<B>Linux-PAM</B>
is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege granting programs (such as
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+login">login</A></B>(1)
and
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+su">su</A></B>(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication tasks.
<P>

The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words, the system administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing applications will authenticate users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single
<B>Linux-PAM</B>
configuration file
FC/etc/pam.confF[]. Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the
FC/etc/pam.d/F[]
directory. The presence of this directory will cause
<B>Linux-PAM</B>
to
<I>ignore</I>
FC/etc/pam.confF[].
<P>

From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the internal behavior of the
<B>Linux-PAM</B>
library. The important point to recognize is that the configuration file(s)
<I>define</I>
the connection between applications
(<B>services</B>) and the pluggable authentication modules
(<B>PAM</B>s) that perform the actual authentication tasks.
<P>

<B>Linux-PAM</B>
separates the tasks of
<I>authentication</I>
into four independent management groups:
<B>account</B>
management;
<B>auth</B>entication management;
<B>password</B>
management; and
<B>session</B>
management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these groups in the configuration file.)
<P>

Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical user's request for a restricted service:
<P>

<B>account</B>
- provide account verification types of service: has the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested service?
<P>

<B>auth</B>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of
<B>Linux-PAM</B>.
<P>

<B>password</B>
- this group's responsibility is the task of updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to those of the
<B>auth</B>
group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.
<P>

<B>session</B>
- this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home directory. The
<B>session</B>
management group is important as it provides both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a user.

<P>

FC/etc/pam.dF[]

<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>

Typically errors generated by the

system of libraries, will be written to
