<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>alternatives</B>

creates, removes, maintains and displays information about the symbolic
links comprising the alternatives system. The alternatives system is
a reimplementation of the Debian alternatives system. It was rewritten
primarily to remove the dependence on perl; it is intended to be a drop
in replacement for Debian's <B>update-dependencies</B> script. This man
page is a slightly modified version of the man page from the Debian project.
<P>

It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar
functions to be installed on a single system at the same time.
For example, many systems have several text editors installed at once.
This gives choice to the users of a system, allowing each to use a
different editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program
to make a good choice of editor to invoke if the
user has not specified a particular preference.
<P>

The alternatives system aims to solve this problem.
A generic name in the filesystem is
shared by all files providing interchangeable functionality.
The alternatives system and the system administrator
together determine which actual file is referenced by this generic name.
For example, if the text editors
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+ed">ed</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+nvi">nvi</A></B>(1)

are both installed on the system, the alternatives system will cause
the generic name
<I>/usr/bin/editor</I>

to refer to
<I>/usr/bin/nvi</I>

by default.  The system administrator can override this and cause
it
to refer to
<I>/usr/bin/ed</I>

instead,
and the alternatives system will not alter this setting until explicitly
requested to do so.
<P>

The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected alternative.
Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the
<I>alternatives</I>

<I>directory</I>,

which in turn is a symbolic link to the actual file referenced.
This is done so that the system administrator's changes can be confined
within the
<I>/etc</I>

directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why this is a Good Thing.
<P>

When each package
providing a file with a particular functionality is
installed, changed or removed,
<B>alternatives</B>

is called to update information about that file in the alternatives system.
<B>alternatives</B>

is usually called from the
<B>%post</B>

or
<B>%pre</B>

scripts in RPM packages.
<P>

It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be synchronised,
so that they are changed as a group; for example, when several versions
of the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+vi">vi</A></B>(1)

editor are installed, the man page referenced by
<I>/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1</I>

should correspond to the executable referenced by
<I>/usr/bin/vi</I>.

<B>alternatives</B>

handles this by means of
<I>master</I>

and
<I>slave</I>

links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are changed
too.
A master link and its associated slaves make up a
<I>link</I>

<I>group</I>.

<P>

Each link group is, at any given time,
in one of two modes: automatic or manual.
When a group is in automatic mode, the alternatives system will
automatically decide, as packages are installed and removed,
whether and how to update the links.
In manual mode, the alternatives system will not change the links;
it will leave all the decisions to the system administrator.
<P>

Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced to
the system.
If the system administrator makes changes to the system's
automatic settings,
this will be noticed the next time
<B>alternatives</B>

is run on the changed link's group,
and the group will automatically be switched to manual mode.
<P>

Each alternative has a
<I>priority</I>

associated with it.
When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives pointed to by members of the group
will be those which have the highest priority.
<P>

When using the
<I>--config</I>

option,
<B>alternatives</B>

will list all of the choices for the link group
of which given
<I>name</I>

is the master link.
You will then be prompted for which of the choices to use
for the link group. Once you make a change, the link group will no
longer be in
<I>auto</I>

mode. You will need to use the
<I>--auto</I>

option in order to return to the automatic state.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TERMINOLOGY</H2>

Since the activities of
<B>alternatives</B>

are quite involved, some specific terms will help to explain its
operation.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>generic name<DD>
A name, like
<I>/usr/bin/editor</I>,

which refers, via the alternatives system, to one of a number of
files of similar function.
<DT>symlink<DD>
Without any further qualification, this means a symbolic link in the
alternatives directory: one which the system administrator is expected
to adjust.
<DT>alternative<DD>
The name of a specific file in the filesystem, which may be made
accessible via a generic name using the alternatives system.
<DT>alternatives directory<DD>
A directory, by default
<I>/etc/alternatives</I>,

containing the symlinks.
<DT>administrative directory<DD>
A directory, by default
<I>/var/lib/alternatives</I>,

containing
<B>alternatives</B>'

state information.
<DT>link group<DD>
A set of related symlinks, intended to be updated as a group.
<DT>master link<DD>
The link in a link group which determines how the other links in the
group are configured.
<DT>slave link<DD>
A link in a link group which is controlled by the setting of
the master link.
<DT>automatic mode<DD>
When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives system ensures that the links in the group
point to the highest priority alternatives
appropriate for the group.
<DT>manual mode<DD>
When a link group is in manual mode,
the alternatives system will not make any changes
to the system administrator's settings.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

Exactly one action must be specified if
<B>alternatives</B>

is to perform any meaningful task.
Any number of the common options may be specified together with any action.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>COMMON OPTIONS</H3>

<DD>
Don't generate any comments unless errors occur.
This option is not yet implemented.
<DT><B>--test</B>

<DD>
Don't actually do anything, just say what would be done.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ACTIONS</H3>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--install</B> <I>link name path priority</I> [<B>--slave</B> <I>slink sname spath</I>] [<B>--initscript</B> <I>service</I>]...<DD>
Add a group of alternatives to the system.
<I>name</I>

is the generic name for the master link,
<I>link</I>

is the name of its symlink,
<I>path</I>

is the alternative being introduced for the master link, and
<I>priority</I>

is the priority of the alternatives group. Higher priorities
take precendence if no alternative is manually selected.
<I>sname</I>,

<I>slink</I>

and
<I>spath</I>

are the generic name, symlink name and alternative
for a slave link, and
<I>service</I>

is the name of any associated initscript for the alternative.
<B>NOTE:</B>

<B>--initscript</B>

is a Red Hat Linux specific option.
Zero or more
<B>--slave</B>

options, each followed by three arguments,
may be specified.
<DT><DD>
If the master symlink specified exists already
in the alternatives system's records,
the information supplied will be added as a new
set of alternatives for the group.
Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode,
will be added with this information.
If the group is in automatic mode,
and the newly added alternatives' priority is higher than
any other installed alternatives for this group,
the symlinks will be updated to point to the newly added alternatives.
<P>
If
<B>--initscript</B>

is used, the alternatives system will manage the initscript
associated with the alternative via
<B>chkconfig,</B>

registering and unregistering the init script depending on
which alternative is active.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>

<B>--initscript</B>

is a Red Hat Linux specific option.
<DT><B>--remove</B> <I>name path</I><DD>
Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.
<I>name</I>

is a name in the alternatives directory, and
<I>path</I>

is an absolute filename to which
<I>name</I>

could be linked.  If
<I>name</I>

is indeed linked to
<I>path</I>,

<I>name</I>

will be updated to point to another appropriate alternative, or
removed if there is no such alternative left.
Associated slave links will be updated or removed, correspondingly.
If the link is not currently pointing to
<I>path</I>,

no links are changed;
only the information about the alternative is removed.
<DT><B>--set</B> <I>name path</I><DD>
The symbolic link and slaves for link group <I>name</I> set to those
configured for <I>path</I>, and the link group is set to manual mode.
This option is not in the original Debian implementation.
<DT><B>--config</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Present the user with a configuration menu for choosing
the master link and slaves for link group <I>name</I>. Once
chosen, the link group is set to manual mode.
<DT><B>--auto</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Switch the master symlink
<I>name</I>

to automatic mode.
In the process, this symlink and its slaves are updated
to point to the highest priority installed alternatives.
<DT><B>--display</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Display information about the link group of which
<I>name</I>

is the master link.
Information displayed includes the group's mode
(auto or manual),
which alternative the symlink currently points to,
what other alternatives are available
(and their corresponding slave alternatives),
and the highest priority alternative currently installed.
