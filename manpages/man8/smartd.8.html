<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


[This man page is generated for the Linux version of smartmontools. It does not contain info specific to other platforms.] <P>


<B>smartd</B> is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis
and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA-3 and
later ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to
monitor the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures,
and to carry out different types of drive self-tests.  This version of
<B>smartd</B> is compatible with ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards (see
<B>REFERENCES</B> below).
<P>
<B>smartd</B> will attempt to enable SMART monitoring on ATA devices
(equivalent to <B>smartctl -s on</B>) and polls these and SCSI devices
every 30 minutes (configurable), logging SMART errors and changes of
SMART Attributes via the SYSLOG interface.  The default location for
these SYSLOG notifications and warnings is system-dependent
(typically <B>/var/log/messages</B> or <B>/var/log/syslog</B>).
To change this default location, please see the <B>'-l'</B>
command-line option described below.
<P>
In addition to logging to a file, <B>smartd</B> can also be configured
to send email warnings if problems are detected.  Depending upon the
type of problem, you may want to run self-tests on the disk, back up
the disk, replace the disk, or use a manufacturer's utility to force
reallocation of bad or unreadable disk sectors.  If disk problems are
detected, please see the <B>smartctl</B> manual page and the
<B>smartmontools</B> web page/FAQ for further guidance.
<P>
If you send a <B>USR1</B> signal to <B>smartd</B> it will immediately
check the status of the disks, and then return to polling the disks
every 30 minutes. See the <B>'-i'</B> option below for additional
details.
<P>
<B>smartd</B> can be configured at start-up using the configuration
file <B>/etc/smartd.conf</B> (Windows: <B>EXEDIR/smartd.conf</B>).
If the configuration file is subsequently modified, <B>smartd</B>
can be told to re-read the configuration file by sending it a
<B>HUP</B> signal, for example with the command:

<B>killall -HUP smartd</B>.




<P>
On startup, if <B>smartd</B> finds a syntax error in the configuration
file, it will print an error message and then exit. However if
<B>smartd</B> is already running, then is told with a <B>HUP</B> signal
to re-read the configuration file, and then find a syntax error in
this file, it will print an error message and then continue, ignoring
the contents of the (faulty) configuration file, as if the <B>HUP</B>
signal had never been received.
<P>
When <B>smartd</B> is running in debug mode, the <B>INT</B> signal
(normally generated from a shell with CONTROL-C) is treated in the
same way as a <B>HUP</B> signal: it makes <B>smartd</B> reload its
configuration file. To exit <B>smartd</B> use CONTROL-\



<P>
On startup, in the absence of the configuration file
<B>/etc/smartd.conf</B>, the <B>smartd</B> daemon first scans for all
devices that support SMART.  The scanning is done as follows:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LINUX:</B><DD>
Examine all entries <B>&quot;/dev/hd[a-t]&quot;</B> for IDE/ATA
devices, and <B>&quot;/dev/sd[a-z]&quot;</B>, <B>&quot;/dev/sd[a-c][a-z]&quot;</B>
for SCSI or SATA devices.
















































</DL>
<P>

<B>smartd</B> then monitors
for <I>all</I> possible SMART errors (corresponding to the <B>'-a'</B>
Directive in the configuration file; see <B>CONFIGURATION FILE</B>
below). 
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-A PREFIX, --attributelog=PREFIX</B>

<DD>
[ATA only] Writes <B>smartd</B> attribute information (normalized and raw
attribute values) to files 'PREFIX''MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv'.  At each
check cycle attributes are logged as a line of semicolon separated triplets
of the form &quot;attribute-ID;attribute-norm-value;attribute-raw-value;&quot;.
Each line is led by a date string of the form &quot;yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS&quot; (in UTC).
<P>






MODEL and SERIAL are build from drive identify information, invalid
characters are replaced by underline.
<P>
If the PREFIX has the form '/path/dir/' (e.g. '/var/lib/smartd/'), then
files 'MODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv' are created in directory '/path/dir'.
If the PREFIX has the form '/path/name' (e.g. '/var/lib/misc/attrlog-'),
then files 'nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.csv' are created in directory '/path/'.
The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.
<DT><B>-B [+]FILE, --drivedb=[+]FILE</B>

<DD>
[ATA only] Read the drive database from FILE.  The new database replaces
the built in database by default.  If '+' is specified, then the new entries
prepend the built in entries.
Please see the <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+smartctl">smartctl</A></B>(8) man page for further details.
<DT><B>-c FILE, --configfile=FILE</B>

<DD>
Read <B>smartd</B> configuration Directives from FILE, instead of from
the default location <B>/etc/smartd.conf</B> (Windows: <B>EXEDIR/smartd.conf</B>).
If FILE does <B>not</B> exist, then <B>smartd</B> will print an error
message and exit with nonzero status.  Thus, '-c /etc/smartd.conf'
can be used to verify the existence of the default configuration file.
<P>
By using '-' for FILE, the configuration is read from standard
input. This is useful for commands like:
<PRE>
<B>echo /dev/hdb -m <A HREF="mailto:user@home">user@home</A> -M test | smartd -c - -q onecheck</B>
</PRE>

to perform quick and simple checks without a configuration file.

<DT><B>-C, --capabilities</B>

<DD>
Use <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+capabilities">capabilities</A>(7)</B>.
<P>
Warning: Mail notification does not work when used.

<DT><B>-d, --debug</B>

<DD>
Runs <B>smartd</B> in &quot;debug&quot; mode. In this mode, it displays status
information to STDOUT rather than logging it to SYSLOG and does not
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+fork">fork</A>(2)</B> into the background and detach from the controlling
terminal.  In this mode, <B>smartd</B> also prints more verbose
information about what it is doing than when operating in &quot;daemon&quot;
mode. In this mode, the <B>QUIT</B> signal (normally generated from a
terminal with CONTROL-C) makes <B>smartd</B> reload its configuration
file.  Please use CONTROL-\ to exit









<DT><B>-D, --showdirectives</B>

<DD>
Prints a list (to STDOUT) of all the possible Directives which may
appear in the configuration file /etc/smartd.conf, and then exits.
These Directives are also described later in this man page. They may
appear in the configuration file following the device name.
<DT><B>-h, --help, --usage</B>

<DD>
Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.
<DT><B>-i N, --interval=N</B>

<DD>
Sets the interval between disk checks to <I>N</I> seconds, where
<I>N</I> is a decimal integer.  The minimum allowed value is ten and
the maximum is the largest positive integer that can be represented on
your system (often 2^31-1).  The default is 1800 seconds.
<P>
Note that the superuser can make <B>smartd</B> check the status of the
disks at any time by sending it the <B>SIGUSR1</B> signal, for example
with the command:
<PRE>
<B>kill -SIGUSR1 &lt;pid&gt;</B>
</PRE>

where <B>&lt;pid&gt;</B> is the process id number of <B>smartd</B>.  One may
also use:
<PRE>
<B>killall -USR1 smartd</B>
</PRE>

for the same purpose.




<DT><B>-l FACILITY, --logfacility=FACILITY</B>

<DD>
Uses syslog facility FACILITY to log the messages from <B>smartd</B>.
Here FACILITY is one of <I>local0</I>, <I>local1</I>, ..., <I>local7</I>,
or <I>daemon</I> [default].  If this command-line option is not used,
then by default messages from <B>smartd</B> are logged to the facility
<I>daemon</I>.
<P>
If you would like to have <B>smartd</B> messages logged somewhere other
than the default location, this can typically be accomplished with
(for example) the following steps:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>[1]</B><DD>
Modify the script that starts <B>smartd</B> to include the <B>smartd</B>
command-line argument '-l local3'.  This tells <B>smartd</B> to log its
messages to facility <B>local3</B>.
<DT><B>[2]</B><DD>
Modify the <B>syslogd</B> configuration file (typically
<B>/etc/syslog.conf</B>) by adding a line of the form:
<PRE>
<B>local3.* /var/log/smartd.log</B>
</PRE>

This tells <B>syslogd</B> to log all the messages from facility <B>local3</B> to
the designated file: /var/log/smartd.log.
<DT><B>[3]</B><DD>
Tell <B>syslogd</B> to re-read its configuration file, typically by
sending the <B>syslogd</B> process a <B>SIGHUP</B> hang-up signal.
<DT><B>[4]</B><DD>
Start (or restart) the <B>smartd</B> daemon.
</DL>
</DL>



<DT><B></B>

<DD>
For more detailed information, please refer to the man pages for
<B>syslog.conf</B>, <B>syslogd</B>, and <B>syslog</B>.  You may also want
to modify the log rotation configuration files; see the man pages for
<B>logrotate</B> and examine your system's /etc/logrotate.conf file.
























<DT><B>-n, --no-fork</B>

<DD>
Do not fork into background; this is useful when executed from modern
init methods like initng, minit or supervise.









<DT><B>-p NAME, --pidfile=NAME</B>

<DD>
Writes pidfile <I>NAME</I> containing the <B>smartd</B> Process ID
number (PID).  To avoid symlink attacks make sure the directory to
which pidfile is written is only writable for root.  Without this
option, or if the --debug option is given, no PID file is written on
startup.  If <B>smartd</B> is killed with a maskable signal then the
pidfile is removed.
<DT><B>-q WHEN, --quit=WHEN</B>

<DD>
Specifies when, if ever, <B>smartd</B> should exit.  The valid
arguments are to this option are:
<P>
<I>nodev</I>

- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
at startup in the configuration file.  This is the default.
<P>
<I>errors</I>

- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
in the configuration file /etc/smartd.conf at startup or whenever it
is reloaded.
<P>
<I>nodevstartup</I>

- Exit if there are no devices to monitor at startup.  But continue
to run if no devices are found whenever the configuration file is
reloaded.
<P>
<I>never</I>

- Only exit if a fatal error occurs (no remaining system memory,
invalid command line arguments). In this mode, even if there are no
devices to monitor, or if the configuration file
<B>/etc/smartd.conf</B> has errors, <B>smartd</B> will continue to run,
waiting to load a configuration file listing valid devices.
<P>
<I>onecheck</I>

- Start <B>smartd</B> in debug mode, then register devices, then check
device's SMART status once, and then exit with zero exit status if all
of these steps worked correctly.
<P>
This last option is intended for 'distribution-writers' who want to
create automated scripts to determine whether or not to automatically
start up <B>smartd</B> after installing smartmontools.  After starting
<B>smartd</B> with this command-line option, the distribution's install
scripts should wait a reasonable length of time (say ten seconds).  If
<B>smartd</B> has not exited with zero status by that time, the script
should send <B>smartd</B> a SIGTERM or SIGKILL and assume that
<B>smartd</B> will not operate correctly on the host.  Conversely, if
<B>smartd</B> exits with zero status, then it is safe to run
<B>smartd</B> in normal daemon mode. If <B>smartd</B> is unable to
monitor any devices or encounters other problems then it will return
with non-zero exit status.
<P>
<I>showtests</I>

- Start <B>smartd</B> in debug mode, then register devices, then write
a list of future scheduled self tests to stdout, and then exit with zero
exit status if all of these steps worked correctly.
Device's SMART status is not checked.
<P>
This option is intended to test whether the '-s REGEX' directives in
smartd.conf will have the desired effect. The output lists the next test
schedules, limited to 5 tests per type and device. This is followed by a
summary of all tests of each device within the next 90 days.
<DT><B>-r TYPE, --report=TYPE</B>

<DD>
Intended primarily to help
<B>smartmontools</B>

developers understand the behavior of
<B>smartmontools</B>

on non-conforming or poorly-conforming hardware.  This option reports
details of
<B>smartd</B>
transactions with the device.  The option can be used multiple times.
When used just once, it shows a record of the ioctl() transactions
with the device.  When used more than once, the detail of these ioctl()
transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid arguments to
this option are:
<P>
<I>ioctl</I>

- report all ioctl() transactions.
<P>
<I>ataioctl</I>

- report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.
<P>
<I>scsiioctl</I>

- report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices.
<P>
Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level of
detail that should be reported.  The argument should be followed by a
comma then the integer with no spaces.  For example, <I>ataioctl,2</I>
The default level is 1, so '-r ataioctl,1' and '-r ataioctl' are
equivalent.
<DT><B>-s PREFIX, --savestates=PREFIX</B>

<DD>
[ATA only] Reads/writes <B>smartd</B> state information from/to files
'PREFIX''MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'. This preserves SMART attributes, drive
min and max temperatures (-W directive), info about last sent warning email
(-m directive), and the time of next check of the self-test REGEXP
(-s directive) across boot cycles.
<P>






MODEL and SERIAL are build from drive identify information, invalid
characters are replaced by underline.
<P>
If the PREFIX has the form '/path/dir/' (e.g. '/var/lib/smartd/'), then
files 'MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state' are created in directory '/path/dir'.
If the PREFIX has the form '/path/name' (e.g. '/var/lib/misc/smartd-'),
then files 'nameMODEL-SERIAL.ata.state' are created in directory '/path/'.
The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.
<P>
The state information files are read on smartd startup. The files are
always (re)written after reading the configuration file, before rereading
the configuration file (SIGHUP), before smartd shutdown, and after a check
forced by SIGUSR1. After a normal check cycle, a file is only rewritten if
an important change (which usually results in a SYSLOG output) occurred.








<DT><B>-V, --version, --license, --copyright</B>

<DD>
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN revision
information for your copy of <B>smartd</B> to STDOUT and then exits.
Please include this information if you are reporting bugs or problems.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>
<B>smartd</B>


Runs the daemon in forked mode. This is the normal way to run
<B>smartd</B>.
Entries are logged to SYSLOG.
<P>
<B>smartd -d -i 30</B>


Run in foreground (debug) mode, checking the disk status
every 30 seconds.
<P>
<B>smartd -q onecheck</B>


Registers devices, and checks the status of the devices exactly
once. The exit status (the bash
<B>$?</B>

variable) will be zero if all went well, and nonzero if no devices
were detected or some other problem was encountered.
<P>

Note that <B>smartmontools</B> provides a start-up script in
<B>/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd</B> which is responsible for starting and
stopping the daemon via the normal init interface.  Using this script,
you can start <B>smartd</B> by giving the command:
<PRE>
<B>/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd start</B>
</PRE>

and stop it by using the command:
<PRE>
<B>/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd stop</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The syntax of the <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+smartd.conf">smartd.conf</A>(5) file is discussed separately.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>smartd</B>
will make log entries at loglevel 
<B>LOG_INFO</B>

if the Normalized SMART Attribute values have changed, as reported using the
<B>'-t', '-p',</B>

or
<B>'-u'</B>

Directives. For example:
<PRE>
<B>'Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 to 93'</B>
</PRE>

Note that in this message, the value given is the 'Normalized' not the 'Raw' 
Attribute value (the disk temperature in this case is about 22
Celsius).  The 
<B>'-R'</B>

and 
<B>'-r'</B>

Directives modify this behavior, so that the information is printed
with the Raw values as well, for example:
<PRE>
<B>'Device: /dev/hda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 [Raw 22] to 93 [Raw 23]'</B>
</PRE>

Here the Raw values are the actual disk temperatures in Celsius.  The
way in which the Raw values are printed, and the names under which the
Attributes are reported, is governed by the various
<B>'-v Num,Description'</B>

Directives described previously.
<P>
Please see the
<B>smartctl</B>

manual page for further explanation of the differences between
Normalized and Raw Attribute values.
<P>
<B>smartd</B>
will make log entries at loglevel
<B>LOG_CRIT</B>

if a SMART Attribute has failed, for example:
<PRE>
<B>'Device: /dev/hdc, Failed SMART Attribute: 5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct'</B>
</PRE>

<BR>&nbsp;This&nbsp;loglevel&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;for&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;enabled&nbsp;by&nbsp;the
<B>'-H', -f', '-l&nbsp;selftest',</B>

and
<B>'-l&nbsp;error'</B>

Directives. Entries reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes
should not be ignored: they mean that the disk is failing.  Use the
<B>smartctl</B>

utility to investigate. 
<P>















































































<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LOG TIMESTAMP TIMEZONE</H2>

<P>
When <B>smartd</B> makes log entries, these are time-stamped.  The time
stamps are in the computer's local time zone, which is generally set
using either the environment variable '<B>TZ</B>' or using a
time-zone file such as <B>/etc/localtime</B>.  You may wish to change
the timezone while <B>smartd</B> is running (for example, if you carry
a laptop to a new time-zone and don't reboot it).  Due to a bug in the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+tzset">tzset</A>(3)</B> function of many unix standard C libraries, the
time-zone stamps of <B>smartd</B> might not change.  For some systems,
<B>smartd</B> will work around this problem <I>if</I> the time-zone is
set using <B>/etc/localtime</B>. The work-around <I>fails</I> if the
time-zone is set using the '<B>TZ</B>' variable (or a file that it
points to).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

The return value (exit status) of 
<B>smartd</B>
can have the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>0:</B>

<DD>
Daemon startup successful, or <B>smartd</B> was killed by a SIGTERM (or in debug mode, a SIGQUIT).
<DT><B>1:</B>

<DD>
Commandline did not parse.
<DT><B>2:</B>

<DD>
There was a syntax error in the config file.
<DT><B>3:</B>

<DD>
Forking the daemon failed.
<DT><B>4:</B>

<DD>
Couldn't create PID file.
<DT><B>5:</B>

<DD>
Config file does not exist (only returned in conjunction with the '-c' option).
<DT><B>6:</B>

<DD>
Config file exists, but cannot be read.
<DT><B>8:</B>

<DD>
<B>smartd</B>
ran out of memory during startup.
<DT><B>9:</B>

<DD>
A compile time constant of<B> smartd</B> was too small.  This can be caused by an
excessive number of disks, or by lines in <B> /etc/smartd.conf</B> that are too long.
Please report this problem to <B> <A HREF="mailto:smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net">smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net</A></B>.
<DT><B>10</B>

<DD>
An inconsistency was found in <B>smartd</B>'s internal data
structures. This should never happen.  It must be due to either a
coding or compiler bug.  <I>Please</I> report such failures to
<A HREF="mailto:smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net">smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net</A>.
<DT><B>16:</B>

<DD>
A device explicitly listed in
<B>/etc/smartd.conf</B>

can't be monitored.
<DT><B>17:</B>

<DD>
<B>smartd</B>
didn't find any devices to monitor.
<DT><B>254:</B>

<DD>
When in daemon mode,
<B>smartd</B>
received a SIGINT or SIGQUIT.  (Note that in debug mode, SIGINT has
the same effect as SIGHUP, and makes <B>smartd</B> reload its
configuration file. SIGQUIT has the same effect as SIGTERM and causes
<B>smartd</B> to exit with zero exit status.
<DT><B>132 and above</B>

<DD>
<B>smartd</B>
was killed by a signal that is not explicitly listed above.  The exit
status is then 128 plus the signal number.  For example if
<B>smartd</B>
is killed by SIGKILL (signal 9) then the exit status is 137.

<H2>REFERENCES FOR SMART</H2>


An introductory article about smartmontools is <I>Monitoring Hard
Disks with SMART</I>, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004,
pages 74-77. This is <B><A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983</A></B>
online.
<P>
If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it
does, a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first
volume of the 'AT Attachment with Packet Interface-7' (ATA/ATAPI-7)
specification Revision 4b.  This documents the SMART functionality which the
<B>smartmontools</B> utilities provide access to.
<P>

The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i
revision 2 and the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications.  These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.
<P>
