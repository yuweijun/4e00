README.hurd - Perl version 5 on Hurd
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
If you want to use Perl on the Hurd, I recommend using the Debian
GNU/Hurd distribution ( see <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A> ), even if an
official, stable release has not yet been made.  The old ``gnu-0.2''
binary distribution will most certainly have additional problems.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Known Problems with Perl on Hurd</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The Perl test suite may still report some errors on the Hurd.  The
``lib/anydbm'' and ``pragma/warnings'' tests will almost certainly fail.
Both failures are not really specific to the Hurd, as indicated by the
test suite output.
<P>

The socket tests may fail if the network is not configured.  You have
to make ``/hurd/pfinet'' the translator for ``/servers/socket/2'', giving
it the right arguments.  Try ``/hurd/pfinet --help'' for more
information.
<P>

Here are the statistics for Perl 5.005_62 on my system:
<P>



<PRE>
 Failed Test  Status Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of failed
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 lib/anydbm.t                 12    1   8.33%  12
 pragma/warnings             333    1   0.30%  215

 8 tests and 24 subtests skipped.
 Failed 2/229 test scripts, 99.13% okay. 2/10850 subtests failed, 99.98% okay.

</PRE>


<P>

There are quite a few systems out there that do worse!
<P>

However, since I am running a very recent Hurd snapshot, in which a lot of
bugs that were exposed by the Perl test suite have been fixed, you may
encounter more failures.  Likely candidates are: ``op/stat'', ``lib/io_pipe'',
``lib/io_sock'', ``lib/io_udp'' and ``lib/time''.
<P>

In any way, if you're seeing failures beyond those mentioned in this
document, please consider upgrading to the latest Hurd before reporting
the failure as a bug.
