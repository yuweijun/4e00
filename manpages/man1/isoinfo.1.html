<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>devdump</B>

is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of device or
filesystem images.
The initial screen is a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte
sector.
The commands are the same as with 
<B>isodump</B>.

<P>

<B>isodump</B>

is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of iso9660 images
in order to verify directory integrity.
The initial screen is a display of the first part of the root directory,
and the prompt shows you the extent number and offset in the extent.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

You can use the 'a' and 'b'
commands to move backwards and forwards within the image. The 'g' command
allows you to goto an arbitrary extent, and the 'f' command specifies
a search string to be used. The '+' command searches forward for the next
instance of the search string, and the 'q' command exits
<B>devdump</B>

or
<B>isodump</B>.

</DL>

<P>

<B>isoinfo</B>

is a utility to perform directory like listings of iso9660 images.
<P>

<B>isovfy</B>

is a utility to verify the integrity of an iso9660 image. Most of the tests
in
<B>isovfy</B>

were added after bugs were discovered in early versions of
<B>genisoimage.</B>

It isn't all that clear how useful this is anymore, but it doesn't hurt to
have this around.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The options common to all programs are
<B>-help</B>,<B>-h</B>,<B>-version</B>,

<B>i</B><I>=name,</I><B>dev</B><I>=name.</I>

The
<B>isoinfo</B>

program has additional command line options. The options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-help</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
print a summary of all options.
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Print information from the primary volume descriptor (PVD) of the iso9660
image. This includes information about Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions
and Eltorito boot information
if present.
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
generate output as if a 'find . -print' command had been run on the iso9660
image. You should not use the
<B>-l</B>

image with the
<B>-f</B>

option.
<DT><B>-i iso_image</B>

<DD>
Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to examine.
The options
<B>-i</B>

and 
<B>dev=</B><I>target</I>

are mutual exclusive.
<DT><B>dev=</B><I>target</I>

<DD>
Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.
A typical device specification is
<B>dev=</B><I>6,0</I>

.
If a filename must be provided together with the numerical target 
specification, the filename is implementation specific.
The correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific
manuals of the target operating system.
On a 
<I>FreeBSD</I>

system without 
<I>CAM</I>

support, you need to use the control device (e.g.
<I>/dev/rcd0.ctl</I>).

A correct device specification in this case may be
<B>dev=</B><I>/dev/rcd0.ctl:@</I>

.
<P>
On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter are mapped
to a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters are mapped to different
targets on this virtual SCSI bus.
<P>
If no 
<I>dev</I>

option is present, the program
will try to get the device from the 
<B>CDR_DEVICE</B>

environment.
<P>
If the argument to the
<B>dev=</B>

option does not contain the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':',
it is interpreted as an label name that may be found in the file
/etc/wodim.conf (see FILES section).
<P>
The options
<B>-i</B>

and 
<B>dev=</B><I>target</I>

are mutual exclusive.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command had been run on the iso9660 image.
You should not use the
<B>-f</B>

image with the
<B>-l</B>

option.
<DT><B>-N sector</B>

<DD>
Quick hack to help examine single session disc files that are to be written to
a multi-session disc. The sector number specified is the sector number at
which the iso9660 image should be written when send to the cd-writer. Not
used for the first session on the disc.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Print path table information.
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Extract information from Rock Ridge extensions (if present) for permissions,
file names and ownerships.
<DT><B>-J</B>

<DD>
Extract information from Joliet extensions (if present) for file names.
<DT><B>-j charset</B>

<DD>
Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the supplied charset. See
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+genisoimage">genisoimage</A></B>(8)

for details.
<DT><B>-T sector</B>

<DD>
Quick hack to help examine multi-session images that have already been burned
to a multi-session disc. The sector number specified is the sector number for
the start of the session we wish to display.
<DT><B>-x pathname</B>

<DD>
Extract specified file to stdout.

<P>

This manpage describes the program implementation of
<B>isoinfo</B>

as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
<B><A HREF="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/">http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/</A></B>

for details. It is a spinoff from the original program distributed in the
cdrtools package [1]. However, the cdrtools
developers are not involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore
shall not be made responsible for any problem caused by it. Do not try to get
support for this program by contacting the original author(s).

<H2>BUGS</H2>

The user interface really sucks.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</H2>

These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very useful for debugging
problems in genisoimage or in an iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it would
be nice to have a daemon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.
<P>

The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the most use to
the general user.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2>

These utilities come with the 
<B>cdrkit</B>

package, and the primary download site
is <A HREF="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/</A> and FTP mirrors of distributions.
Despite the name, the software is not beta.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>CDR_DEVICE</B>

<DD>
This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to the open
call of the SCSI transport library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf.
<DT><B>RSH</B>

<DD>
If the 
<B>RSH</B>

environment is present, the remote connection will not be created via
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+rcmd">rcmd</A></B>(3)

but by calling the program pointed to by
<B>RSH</B>.

Use e.g. 
<B>RSH=</B>/usr/bin/ssh

to create a secure shell connection.
<P>
Note that this forces the program
to create a pipe to the 
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+rsh">rsh</A>(1)</B>

program and disallows the program
to directly access the network socket to the remote server.
This makes it impossible to set up performance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a 
<B>root</B>

initiated
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+rcmd">rcmd</A>(3)</B>

connection.
<DT><B>RSCSI</B>

<DD>
If the 
<B>RSCSI</B>

environment is present, the remote SCSI server will not be the program
<B>/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi</B>

but the program pointed to by
<B>RSCSI</B>.

Note that the remote SCSI server program name will be ignored if you log in
using an account that has been created with a remote SCSI server program as
login shell.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>/etc/wodim.conf<DD>
Default values can be set for the following options in /etc/wodim.conf.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CDR_DEVICE<DD>
This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to the open
call of the SCSI transport library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf
that allows to identify a specific drive on the system.
<DT>Any other label<DD>
is an identifier for a specific drive on the system.
Such an identifier may not contain the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':'.
<P>
Each line that follows a label contains a TAB separated list of items.
Currently, four items are recognized: the SCSI ID of the drive, the
default speed that should be used for this drive, the default FIFO size
that should be used for this drive and drive specific options. The values for 
<I>speed</I>

and
<I>fifosize</I>

may be set to -1 to tell the program to use the global defaults.
The value for driveropts may be set to &quot;&quot; if no driveropts are used.
A typical line may look this way:
<P>
teac1= 0,5,0<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>4<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>8m<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&quot;&quot;<BR>
<P>
yamaha= 1,6,0<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-1<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-1<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>burnfree<BR>
<P>
This tells the program
that a drive named
<I>teac1</I>

is at scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should be used with speed 4 and
a FIFO size of 8 MB.
A second drive may be found at scsibus 1, target 6, lun 0 and uses the
default speed and the default FIFO size.
