<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>host</B>
<DD>is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given,
<B>host</B>
prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options.
<P>

<I>name</I>
is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which case
<B>host</B>
will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address.
<I>server</I>
is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address of the name server that
<B>host</B>
should query instead of the server or servers listed in
<I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>.
<P>

The
<B>-a</B>
(all) option is equivalent to setting the
<B>-v</B>
option and asking
<B>host</B>
to make a query of type ANY.
<P>

When the
<B>-C</B>
option is used,
<B>host</B>
will attempt to display the SOA records for zone
<I>name</I>
from all the listed authoritative name servers for that zone. The list of name servers is defined by the NS records that are found for the zone.
<P>

The
<B>-c</B>
option instructs to make a DNS query of class
<I>class</I>. This can be used to lookup Hesiod or Chaosnet class resource records. The default class is IN (Internet).
<P>

Verbose output is generated by
<B>host</B>
when the
<B>-d</B>
or
<B>-v</B>
option is used. The two options are equivalent. They have been provided for backwards compatibility. In previous versions, the
<B>-d</B>
option switched on debugging traces and
<B>-v</B>
enabled verbose output.
<P>

List mode is selected by the
<B>-l</B>
option. This makes
<B>host</B>
perform a zone transfer for zone
<I>name</I>. Transfer the zone printing out the NS, PTR and address records (A/AAAA). If combined with
<B>-a</B>
all records will be printed.
<P>

The
<B>-i</B>
option specifies that reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses should use the IP6.INT domain as defined in RFC1886. The default is to use IP6.ARPA.
<P>

The
<B>-N</B>
option sets the number of dots that have to be in
<I>name</I>
for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in
<I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the
<B>search</B>
or
<B>domain</B>
directive in
<I>/etc/resolv.conf</I>.
<P>

The number of UDP retries for a lookup can be changed with the
<B>-R</B>
option.
<I>number</I>
indicates how many times
<B>host</B>
will repeat a query that does not get answered. The default number of retries is 1. If
<I>number</I>
is negative or zero, the number of retries will default to 1.
<P>

Non-recursive queries can be made via the
<B>-r</B>
option. Setting this option clears the
<B>RD</B>
--- recursion desired --- bit in the query which
<B>host</B>
makes. This should mean that the name server receiving the query will not attempt to resolve
<I>name</I>. The
<B>-r</B>
option enables
<B>host</B>
to mimic the behavior of a name server by making non-recursive queries and expecting to receive answers to those queries that are usually referrals to other name servers.
<P>

By default,
<B>host</B>
uses UDP when making queries. The
<B>-T</B>
option makes it use a TCP connection when querying the name server. TCP will be automatically selected for queries that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests.
<P>

The
<B>-4</B>
option forces
<B>host</B>
to only use IPv4 query transport. The
<B>-6</B>
option forces
<B>host</B>
to only use IPv6 query transport.
<P>

The
<B>-t</B>
option is used to select the query type.
<I>type</I>
can be any recognized query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, etc. When no query type is specified,
<B>host</B>
automatically selects an appropriate query type. By default, it looks for A, AAAA, and MX records, but if the
<B>-C</B>
option was given, queries will be made for SOA records, and if
<I>name</I>
is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 address,
<B>host</B>
will query for PTR records. If a query type of IXFR is chosen the starting serial number can be specified by appending an equal followed by the starting serial number (e.g. -t IXFR=12345678).
<P>

The time to wait for a reply can be controlled through the
<B>-W</B>
and
<B>-w</B>
options. The
<B>-W</B>
option makes
<B>host</B>
wait for
<I>wait</I>
seconds. If
<I>wait</I>
is less than one, the wait interval is set to one second. When the
<B>-w</B>
option is used,
<B>host</B>
will effectively wait forever for a reply. The time to wait for a response will be set to the number of seconds given by the hardware's maximum value for an integer quantity.
<P>

The
<B>-s</B>
option tells
<B>host</B>
<I>not</I>
to send the query to the next nameserver if any server responds with a SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior.
<P>

The
<B>-m</B>
can be used to set the memory usage debugging flags
<I>record</I>,
<I>usage</I>
and
<I>trace</I>.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IDN SUPPORT</H2>

<P>

If
<B>host</B>
has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names.
<B>host</B>
appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the
<B>IDN_DISABLE</B>
environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when
<B>host</B>
runs.
