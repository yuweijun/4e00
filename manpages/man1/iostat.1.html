<H2>NAME</H2>

iostat - Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and input/output
statistics for devices, partitions and network filesystems (NFS).
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -N ] [ -n ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -z ] [</B>

<I>device</I>

<B>[...] | ALL ] [ -p [</B>

<I>device</I>

<B>[,...] | ALL ] ] [</B>

<I>interval</I>

<B>[</B>

<I>count</I>

<B>] ]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>iostat</B>

command is used for monitoring system input/output device
loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation
to their average transfer rates. The
<B>iostat</B>

command generates reports
that can be used to change system configuration to better balance
the input/output load between physical disks.
<P>
The first report generated by the
<B>iostat</B>

command provides statistics
concerning the time since the system was booted. Each subsequent report
covers the time since the previous report. All statistics are reported
each time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a
CPU header row followed by a row of
CPU statistics. On
multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated system-wide
as averages among all processors. A device header row is displayed
followed by a line of statistics for each device that is configured.
When option -n is used, an NFS header row is displayed followed by
a line of statistics for each network filesystem that is mounted.
<P>
The
<I>interval</I>

parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between
each report. The first report contains statistics for the time since
system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains statistics
collected during the interval since the previous report. The
<I>count</I>

parameter can be specified in conjunction with the
<I>interval</I>

parameter. If the
<I>count</I>

parameter is specified, the value of
<I>count</I>

determines the number of reports generated at
<I>interval</I>

seconds apart. If the
<I>interval</I>

parameter is specified without the
<I>count</I>

parameter, the
<B>iostat</B>

command generates reports continuously.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REPORTS</H2>

The
<B>iostat</B>

command generates three types of reports, the CPU
Utilization report, the Device Utilization report and
the Network Filesystem report.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CPU Utilization Report<DD>
The first report generated by the
<B>iostat</B>

command is the CPU
Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU values are
global averages among all processors.
The report has the following format:
<P>
<B>%user</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level (application).
</DL>

<P>
<B>%nice</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level with nice priority.
</DL>

<P>
<B>%system</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the system level (kernel).
</DL>

<P>
<B>%iowait</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which
the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
</DL>

<P>
<B>%steal</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU
or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
</DL>

<P>
<B>%idle</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system
did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.
</DL>

</DL>

<DT>Device Utilization Report<DD>
The second report generated by the
<B>iostat</B>

command is the Device Utilization
Report. The device report provides statistics on a per physical device
or partition basis. Block devices for which statistics are to be displayed
may be entered on the command line. Partitions may also be entered on the
command line providing that option -x is not used.
If no device nor partition
is entered, then statistics are displayed
for every device used by the system, and
providing that the kernel maintains statistics for it.
If the
<B>ALL</B>

keyword is given on the command line, then statistics are
displayed for every device defined by the system, including those
that have never been used.
The report may show the following fields,
depending on the flags used:
<P>
<B>Device:</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This column gives the device (or partition) name, which is displayed as
<I>hdisk</I>n

<I>dev</I>m-n

with 2.4 kernels, where
<B>m</B>

is displayed.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-c<DD>
Display the CPU utilization report.
<DT>-d<DD>
Display the device utilization report.
<DT>-h<DD>
Make the NFS report displayed by option -n easier to read by a human.
<DT>-k<DD>
Display statistics in kilobytes per second instead of blocks per second.
Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.
<DT>-m<DD>
Display statistics in megabytes per second instead of blocks or
kilobytes per second.
Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.
<DT>-N<DD>
Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.
Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.
<DT>-n<DD>
Display the network filesystem (NFS) report. This option works only with kernel
2.6.17 and later.
<DT>-p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]<DD>
The -p option displays statistics for
block devices and all their partitions that are used by the system.
If a device name is entered on the command line, then statistics for it
and all its partitions are displayed. Last, the
<B>ALL</B>

keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the block
devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have
never been used.
Note that this option works only with post 2.5 kernels.
<DT>-t<DD>
Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format may depend
on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable (see below).
<DT>-V<DD>
Print version number then exit.
<DT>-x<DD>
Display extended statistics.
This option works with
post 2.5 kernels since it needs /proc/diskstats file or a mounted sysfs to
get the statistics. This option may also work with older kernels (e.g. 2.4)
only if extended statistics are available in /proc/partitions (the kernel
needs to be patched for that).
<DT>-z<DD>
Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity
during the sample period.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

The
<B>iostat</B>

command takes into account the following environment variable:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>S_TIME_FORMAT<DD>
If this variable exists and its value is
<B>ISO</B>

then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report
header. The
<B>iostat</B>

command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
The timestamp displayed with option -t will also be compliant with ISO 8601
format.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<B>iostat</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Display a single history since boot report for all CPU and Devices.
<P>
</DL>

<B>iostat -d 2</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.
<P>
</DL>

<B>iostat -d 2 6</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.
<P>
</DL>

<B>iostat -x hda hdb 2 6</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Display six reports of extended statistics at two second intervals for devices
hda and hdb.
<P>
</DL>

<B>iostat -p sda 2 6</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda and all its
partitions (sda1, etc.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<I>/proc</I>

filesystem must be mounted for
<B>iostat</B>

to work.
<P>
Extended statistics are available only with post 2.5 kernels.
<P>
The average service time (<B>svctm</B> field) value is meaningless, as I/O statistics
are calculated at block level, and we don't know when the disk driver starts to
process a request. For this reason, this field will be removed in a future
sysstat version.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<I>/proc/stat</I>

contains system statistics.
<P>
<I>/proc/uptime</I>

contains system uptime.
<P>
<I>/proc/partitions</I>

contains disk statistics (for pre 2.5 kernels that have been patched).
<P>
<I>/proc/diskstats</I>

contains disks statistics (for post 2.5 kernels).
<P>
<I>/sys</I>

contains statistics for block devices (post 2.5 kernels).
<P>
<I>/proc/self/mountstats</I>

contains statistics for network filesystems.
