<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>zip</I>

is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn
RISC OS.  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+tar">tar</A></I>(1)

and
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+compress">compress</A></I>(1)

and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
<P>

A companion program
(<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1L+unzip">unzip</A></I>(1L))

unpacks
<I>zip</I>

archives.
The
<I>zip</I>

and
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1L+unzip">unzip</A></I>(1L)

programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting
most PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6),
and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
<I>zip</I> (with some exceptions, notably streamed archives,
but recent changes in the zip file standard may facilitate
better compatibility).
<I>zip</I>

version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04 and also supports
the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allow archives
as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in
some cases).  <I>zip</I> also now supports <B>bzip2</B> compression
if the <B>bzip2</B> library is included when <I>zip</I> is compiled.
Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by
PKZIP 2.04 or
<I>zip&nbsp;3.0</I>. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
<I>unzip&nbsp;5.0p1</I> (or later versions) to extract them.
<P>

See the <B>EXAMPLES</B> section at the bottom of this page
for examples of some typical uses of <I>zip</I>.
<P>

<B>Large&nbsp;Archives&nbsp;and&nbsp;Zip64.</B>
<I>zip</I>

automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when files larger than 4 GB are
added to an archive, an archive containing Zip64 entries is updated
(if the resulting archive still needs Zip64),
the size of the archive will exceed 4 GB, or when the
number of entries in the archive will exceed about 64K.
Zip64 is also used for archives streamed from standard input as the size
of such archives are not known in advance, but the option <B>-fz-</B> can
be used to force <I>zip</I> to create PKZIP 2 compatible archives (as long
as Zip64 extensions are not needed).  You must use a PKZIP 4.5
compatible unzip, such as <I>unzip&nbsp;6.0</I> or later, to extract files
using the Zip64 extensions.
<P>

In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard encryption,
or split archives created with the pause option may not be compatible with
PKZIP as data descriptors are used
and PKZIP at the time of this writing does not support data descriptors
(but recent changes in the PKWare published zip standard now include some
support for the data descriptor format <I>zip</I> uses).
<P>
<P>

<B>Mac OS X.</B>  Though previous Mac versions had their own <I>zip</I> port,
<I>zip</I> supports Mac OS X as part of the Unix port and most Unix features
apply.  References to &quot;MacOS&quot; below generally refer to MacOS versions older
than OS X.  Support for some Mac OS features in the Unix Mac OS X port, such
as resource forks, is expected in the next <I>zip</I> release.
<P>
<P>

For a brief help on <I>zip</I> and <I>unzip</I>,
run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USE</H2>

<P>

The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;
for archiving files;
and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.
<P>

The
<I>zip</I>

program puts one or more compressed files into a single
<I>zip</I>

archive,
along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity).
An entire directory structure can be packed into a
<I>zip</I>

archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.
<I>zip</I>

has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without
compression.  (If <B>bzip2</B> support is added, <I>zip</I> can also
compress using <B>bzip2</B> compression, but such entries require a
reasonably modern unzip to decompress.  When <B>bzip2</B> compression
is selected, it replaces deflation as the default method.)
<I>zip</I>

automatically chooses the better of the two (deflation or store or, if
<B>bzip2</B> is selected, <B>bzip2</B> or store) for each file to be
compressed.
<P>

<B>Command&nbsp;format.</B>  The basic command format is
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>zip</B> options archive inpath inpath ...
</DL>
<P>

where <B>archive</B> is a new or existing <I>zip</I> archive
and <B>inpath</B> is a directory or file path optionally including wildcards.
When given the name of an existing
<I>zip</I>

archive,
<I>zip</I>

will replace identically named entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive (matching the relative names as stored in
the archive) or add entries for new names.
For example,
if
<I>foo.zip</I>

exists and contains
<I>foo/file1</I>

and
<I>foo/file2</I>,

and the directory
<I>foo</I>

contains the files
<I>foo/file1</I>

and
<I>foo/file3</I>,

then:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo.zip foo
</DL>
<P>

or more concisely
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
<P>

will replace
<I>foo/file1</I>

in
<I>foo.zip</I>

and add
<I>foo/file3</I>

to
<I>foo.zip</I>.

After this,
<I>foo.zip</I>

contains
<I>foo/file1</I>,

<I>foo/file2</I>,

and
<I>foo/file3</I>,

with
<I>foo/file2</I>

unchanged from before.
<P>

So if before the zip command is executed <I>foo.zip</I> has:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
 foo/file1 foo/file2
</DL>
<P>

and directory foo has:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
 file1 file3
</DL>
<P>

then <I>foo.zip</I> will have:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
 foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3
</DL>
<P>

where <I>foo/file1</I> is replaced and
<I>foo/file3</I> is new.
<P>

<B>-@&nbsp;file&nbsp;lists.</B>  If a file list is specified as
<B>-@</B>
[Not on MacOS],
<I>zip</I>

takes the list of input files from standard input instead of from
the command line.  For example,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -@ foo
</DL>
<P>

will store the files listed one per line on stdin in <I>foo.zip</I>.
<P>

Under Unix,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the
<I>find</I>&nbsp;(1)
command.
For example,
to archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
find . -name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source -@
</DL>
<P>

(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).
<P>

<B>Streaming&nbsp;input&nbsp;and&nbsp;output.</B>
<I>zip</I>

will also accept a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the zip file name, in which case it
will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped
to another program. For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.
<P>

<I>zip</I>

also accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the name of a file to be compressed, in
which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip backup -
</DL>
<P>

would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better compression than
the previous example using the -r option because
<I>zip</I>

can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored
using the command
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
unzip -p backup | tar xf -
</DL>
<P>

When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
<I>zip</I>

acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
For example,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

is equivalent to
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

<I>zip</I>

archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program
<I>funzip</I>

which is provided in the
<I>unzip</I>

package, or by
<I>gunzip</I>

which is provided in the
<I>gzip</I>

package (but some
<I>gunzip</I>

may not support this if
<I>zip</I>

used the Zip64 extensions). For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -
</DL>
<P>

The stream can also be saved to a file and
<I>unzip</I>

used.
<P>

If Zip64 support for large files and archives is enabled and
<I>zip</I> is used as a filter, <I>zip</I> creates a Zip64 archive
that requires a PKZIP 4.5 or later compatible unzip to read it.  This is
to avoid amgibuities in the zip file structure as defined in the current
zip standard (PKWARE AppNote) where the decision to use Zip64 needs to
be made before data is written for the entry, but for a stream the size
of the data is not known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller
than 4 GB, the option <B>-fz-</B> can be used to prevent use of Zip64,
but <I>zip</I> will exit with an error if Zip64 was in fact needed.
<I>zip&nbsp;3</I> and <I>unzip&nbsp;6</I> and later can read archives with Zip64
entries.  Also, <I>zip</I> removes the Zip64 extensions if not needed
when archive entries are copied (see the <B>-U</B> (<B>--copy</B>)
option).
<P>

When directing the output to another file, note that all options should be
before the redirection including <B>-x</B>.  For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive &quot;*.h&quot; &quot;*.c&quot; -x donotinclude.h orthis.h &gt; tofile
</DL>
<P>

<B>Zip&nbsp;files.</B>  When changing an existing
<I>zip</I>

archive,
<I>zip</I>

will write a temporary file with the new contents,
and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version
has been completed without error.
<P>

If the name of the
<I>zip</I>

archive does not contain an extension, the extension
<B>.zip</B>
is added. If the name already contains an extension other than
<B>.zip</B>,
the existing extension is kept unchanged.  However, split archives
(archives split over multiple files) require the <B>.zip</B> extension
on the last split.
<P>

<B>Scanning&nbsp;and&nbsp;reading&nbsp;files.</B>
When <I>zip</I> starts, it scans for files to process (if needed).  If
this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds, <I>zip</I> will display
a &quot;Scanning files&quot; message and start displaying progress dots every 2 seconds
or every so many entries processed, whichever takes longer.  If there is more
than 2 seconds between dots it could indicate that finding each file is taking
time and could mean a slow network connection for example.
(Actually the initial file scan is
a two-step process where the directory scan is followed by a sort and these
two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If updating an existing
archive, a space also appears between the existing file scan and the new
file scan.)  The scanning files dots are not controlled by the <B>-ds</B>
dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the <B>-q</B> quiet option.  The
<B>-sf</B> show files option can be used to scan for files and get the list of
files scanned without actually processing them.
<P>

If <I>zip</I> is not able to read a file, it
issues a warning but
continues.  See the <B>-MM</B> option below for more on how <I>zip</I> handles
patterns that are not matched and files that are not readable.
If some files were skipped, a
warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how many files
were read and how many skipped.
<P>

<B>Command&nbsp;modes.</B>  <I>zip</I> now supports two distinct types of command
modes, <B>external</B> and <B>internal</B>.  The <B>external</B> modes
(add, update, and freshen) read files from the file system (as well as from an
existing archive) while the <B>internal</B> modes (delete and copy) operate
exclusively on entries in an existing archive.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>add&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>

<DD>
Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does not exist
create it.  This is the default mode.
<DT><B>update&nbsp;</B>(<B>-u</B>)

<DD>
Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files.  If
the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.
<DT><B>freshen&nbsp;</B>(<B>-f</B>)

<DD>
Update existing entries of an archive if newer on the file system.
Does not add new files to the archive.
<DT><B>delete&nbsp;</B>(<B>-d</B>)

<DD>
Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.
<DT><B>copy&nbsp;</B>(<B>-U</B>)

<DD>
Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive.
This new mode is similar to <B>update</B> but command line patterns
select entries in the existing archive rather than files from
the file system and it uses the <B>--out</B> option to write the
resulting archive to a new file rather than update the existing
archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.
</DL>
<P>

The new File Sync option (<B>-FS</B>) is also considered a new mode,
though it is similar to <B>update</B>.  This mode synchronizes the
archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the
archive if the file time or size of the OS file is different, adding
new files, and deleting entries from the archive where there is
no matching file.  As this mode can delete entries from the archive,
consider making a backup copy of the archive.
<P>
Also see <B>-DF</B> for creating difference archives.
<P>
See each option description below for details and the <B>EXAMPLES</B> section
below for examples.
<P>

<B>Split&nbsp;archives.</B>  <I>zip</I> version 3.0 and later can create split
archives.  A
<B>split archive</B> is a standard zip archive split over multiple
files.  (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to
pieces, as the offsets of entries are now based on the start of each
split.  Concatenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets,
but <I>unzip</I> can usually deal with it.  <I>zip</I> will usually refuse
to process such a spliced archive unless the <B>-FF</B> fix option is
used to fix the offsets.)
<P>

One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple
removable media.
For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typically named (replace
ARCHIVE with the name of your archive) ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19,
ARCHIVE.zip.  Note that the last file is the <B>.zip</B> file.  In contrast,
<B>spanned archives</B> are the original multi-disk archive generally requiring
floppy disks and using volume labels to store disk numbers.  <I>zip</I> supports
split archives but not spanned archives, though a procedure exists for converting
split archives of the right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also true,
where each file of a spanned archive can be copied in order to files with the
above names to create a split archive.
<P>

Use <B>-s</B> to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is
given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB)
(the default is m).  The <B>-sp</B> option can be used to pause <I>zip</I> between
splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read the descriptions
and warnings for both <B>-s</B> and <B>-sp</B> below.
<P>

Though <I>zip</I> does not update split archives, <I>zip</I> provides the new
option <B>-O</B> (<B>--output-file</B> or <B>--out</B>) to allow split archives
to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip
</DL>
<P>

reads archive <B>inarchive.zip</B>, even if split, adds the files <B>foo.c</B> and
<B>bar.c</B>, and writes the resulting archive to <B>outarchive.zip</B>.  If
<B>inarchive.zip</B> is split then <B>outarchive.zip</B> defaults to the same
split size.  Be aware that if <B>outarchive.zip</B> and any split files that are
created with it already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without
warning.  This may be changed in the future.
<P>

<B>Unicode.</B>  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an archive using
a specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in archives in whatever
the local character set is.  This creates problems when an archive is created or
updated on a system using one character set and then extracted on another system
using a different character set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on
platforms that support wide characters, <I>zip</I> now stores, in addition to the
standard local path for backward compatibility, the UTF-8 translation of the path.
This provides a common universal character set for storing paths that allows these
paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support Unicode and to match as
close as possible on systems that don't.
<P>
On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but represented in
the local character set, it's possible that some paths will be skipped during a
local character set directory scan.  <I>zip</I> with Unicode support now can read
and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x systems and FAT file systems don't fully
support Unicode.
<P>
Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes don't
accurately show all characters due to how each operating system switches in
character sets for display.  However, directory navigation tools should show the
correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.
<P>

<B>Command line format.</B>  This version of
<I>zip</I>

has updated command line processing and support for long options.
<P>

Short options take the form
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
-s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][&nbsp;value]
</DL>
<P>

where s is a one or two character short option.  A short option
that takes a value is last in an argument and anything after it is
taken as the value.  If the option can be negated and &quot;-&quot; immediately
follows the option, the option is negated.
Short options can also be given as separate arguments
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
-s[-][value][=value][&nbsp;value]&nbsp;-s[-][value][=value][&nbsp;value]&nbsp;...
</DL>
<P>

Short options in general take values either as part of the same
argument or as the following argument.  An optional = is also supported.
So
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
-ttmmddyyyy
</DL>
<P>

and
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
-tt=mmddyyyy
</DL>
<P>

and
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
-tt mmddyyyy
</DL>
<P>

all work.  The <B>-x</B> and <B>-i</B> options accept lists of values
and use a slightly different format described below.  See the
<B>-x</B> and <B>-i</B> options.
<P>

Long options take the form
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
--longoption[-][=value][ value]
</DL>
<P>

where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can
include a trailing dash to negate the option (if the option
supports it), and can have a value (option argument) specified by
preceeding it with = (no spaces).  Values can also follow the
argument.  So
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
--before-date=mmddyyyy
</DL>
<P>

and
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
--before-date mmddyyyy
</DL>
<P>

both work.
<P>
Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique
abbreviation.  See the option descriptions below for which
support long options.  To avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating
a negatable option with an embedded dash (&quot;-&quot;) at the dash
if you plan to negate it (the parser would consider
a trailing dash, such as for the option <B>--some-option</B> using
<B>--some-</B> as the option, as part of the name rather
than a negating dash).  This may be changed to force the last
dash in <B>--some-</B> to be negating in the future.

The archive bit is set by the operating system when a file is modified

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -b /tmp stuff *
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will put the temporary
<I>zip</I>

archive in the directory
<I>/tmp</I>,

copying over
<I>stuff.zip</I>

to the current directory when done. This option is useful when
updating an existing archive and the file system containing this
old archive does not have enough space to hold both old and new archives
at the same time.  It may also be useful when streaming in some
cases to avoid the need for data descriptors.  Note that using
this option may require <I>zip</I> take additional time to copy
the archive file when done to the destination file system.

<B>--delete</B>

Remove (delete) entries from a
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\* \*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will remove the entry
<I>foo/tom/junk</I>,

all of the files that start with
<I>foo/harry/</I>,

and all of the files that end with
<B>.o</B>

(in any path).
Note that shell pathname expansion has been inhibited with backslashes,
so that
<I>zip</I>

can see the asterisks,
enabling
<I>zip</I>

to match on the contents of the
<I>zip</I>

archive instead of the contents of the current directory.
(The backslashes are not used on MSDOS-based platforms.)
Can also use quotes to escape the asterisks as in
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -d foo foo/tom/junk &quot;foo/harry/*&quot; &quot;*.o&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Not escaping the asterisks on a system where the shell expands
wildcards could result in the asterisks being converted to a
list of files in the current directory and that list used to
delete entries from the archive.
<DT><DD>
Under MSDOS,
<B>-d</B>

is case sensitive when it matches names in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
This requires that file names be entered in upper case if they were
zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We considered making this
case insensitive on systems where paths were case insensitive,
but it is possible the archive came from a system where case does
matter and the archive could include both <B>Bar</B> and <B>bar</B>
as separate files in the archive.)  But see the new option <B>-ic</B>
to ignore case in the archive.

<B>--display-dots</B>

Display dots while each entry is zipped (except on ports that have their own
progress indicator).  See <B>-ds</B> below for setting dot size.  The default is
a dot every 10 MB of input file processed.  The <B>-v</B> option
also displays dots (previously at a much higher rate than this but now <B>-v</B>
also defaults to 10 MB) and this rate is also controlled by <B>-ds</B>.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--dot-size&nbsp;</B>size

Set amount of input file processed for each dot displayed.  See <B>-dd</B> to
enable displaying dots.  Setting this option implies <B>-dd</B>.  Size is
in the format nm where n is a number and m is a multiplier.  Currently m can
be k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB), so if n is 100 and m is k, size would be
100k which is 100 KB.  The default is 10 MB.
<DT><DD>
The <B>-v</B> option also displays dots and now defaults to
10 MB also.  This rate is also controlled by this option.  A size of 0 turns dots off.
<DT><DD>
This option does not control the dots from the &quot;Scanning files&quot; message as
<I>zip</I> scans for input files.  The dot size for that is fixed at 2 seconds
or a fixed number of entries, whichever is longer.

<DD>
<B>--no-dir-entries</B>

Do not create entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive for directories.  Directory entries are created by default so that
their attributes can be saved in the zip archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with sh:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
ZIPOPT=&quot;-D&quot;; export ZIPOPT
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
(The variable ZIPOPT can be used for any option, including <B>-i</B> and <B>-x</B>
using a new option format detailed below, and can include several options.) The option
<B>-D</B>

is a shorthand
for
<B>-x</B>

&quot;*/&quot; but the latter previously could not be set as default in the ZIPOPT
environment variable as the contents of ZIPOPT gets inserted near the beginning
of the command line and the file list had to end at the end of the line.
<DT><DD>
This version of
<I>zip</I>

does allow
<B>-x</B>

and
<B>-i</B>

options in ZIPOPT if the form
<DT><DD>

<B>-x</B>&nbsp;file&nbsp;file&nbsp;...<B>&nbsp;@</B>

<DT><DD>
is used, where the @ (an argument that is just @) terminates
the list.
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-DF</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--difference-archive</B>

Create an archive that contains all new and changed files since
the original archive was created.  For this to work, the input
file list and current directory must be the same as during the
original <I>zip</I> operation.
<DT><DD>
For example, if the existing archive was created using
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foofull .
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
from the <I>bar</I> directory, then the command
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
also from the <I>bar</I> directory creates the archive <I>foonew</I>
with just the files not in <I>foofull</I> and the files where
the size or file time of the files do not match those in <I>foofull</I>.
<P>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A
change in timezone since the original archive was created could
result in no times matching and all files being included.
<P>
A possible approach to backing up a directory might be to create
a normal archive of the contents of the directory as a full
backup, then use this option to create incremental backups.

<B>--encrypt</B>

Encrypt the contents of the

(this will not be echoed; if standard error is not a tty,
<I>zip</I>

will exit with an error).
The password prompt is repeated to save the user from typing errors.

<B>--freshen</B>

Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the
<I>zip</I>

archive only if it has been modified more recently than the
version already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive;
unlike the update option
(<B>-u</B>)

this will not add files that are not already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -f foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
This command should be run from the same directory from which the original
<I>zip</I>

command was run, since paths stored in
<I>zip</I>

archives are always relative.
<DT><DD>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for the
<B>-f</B>, <B>-u</B> and <B>-o</B>
options to work correctly.
<DT><DD>
The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other
operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two.
A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic
adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).
<DT><DD>
The format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET, hh is the
difference between GMT and local time such as -1 above, and DDD is
the time zone when daylight savings time is in effect.  Leave off
the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.  For the US Eastern
time zone EST5EDT.

<DD>
<DT><B>-FF</B>

<DD>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>--fixfix&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>

Fix the
<I>zip</I>

archive. The <B>-F</B> option can be used if some portions of the archive
are missing, but requires a reasonably intact central directory.
The input archive is scanned as usual, but <I>zip</I> will ignore
some problems.  The resulting archive should be valid, but any
inconsistent entries will be left out.
<DT><DD>
When doubled as in
<B>-FF</B>,
the archive is scanned from the beginning and <I>zip</I> scans for special
signatures to identify the limits between the archive members. The
single
<B>-F</B>

is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, so try this
option first.
<DT><DD>
If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you
must use <B>-FF</B>.  This is a change from <I>zip&nbsp;2.32</I>, where
the <B>-F</B> option is able to read a truncated archive.  The
<B>-F</B> option now more reliably fixes archives with minor
damage and the <B>-FF</B> option is needed to fix archives where
<B>-F</B> might have been sufficient before.
<DT><DD>
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
<B>-t</B>

option of
<I>unzip</I>

may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered;
you can remove them from the archive using the
<B>-d</B>

option of
<I>zip</I>.
<DT><DD>
Note that <B>-FF</B> may have trouble fixing archives that include an
embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in the archive
and, depending on the damage, it may find the entries in the embedded
archive rather than the archive itself.  Try <B>-F</B> first as it
does not have this problem.
<DT><DD>
The format of the fix commands have changed.  For example, to fix
the damaged archive <I>foo.zip</I>,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -F foo --out foofix
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the
new archive <I>foofix.zip</I>.  If this doesn't work, as when the
archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the archive
are missed, then try
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -FF foo --out foofixfix
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by <B>-F</B>.  The
<B>-FF</B> option may create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on
what is damaged, you can then use the <B>-F</B> option to fix that archive.
<DT><DD>
A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using
<B>-F</B> if you have the last split of the archive (the <B>.zip</B> file).
If this file is missing, you must use <B>-FF</B> to fix the archive,
which will prompt you for the splits you have.
<DT><DD>
Currently the fix options can't recover entries that have a bad checksum
or are otherwise damaged.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-FI</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--fifo</B>

[Unix]  Normally <I>zip</I> skips reading any FIFOs (named pipes) encountered, as
<I>zip</I> can hang if the FIFO is not being fed.  This option tells <I>zip</I> to
read the contents of any FIFO it finds.
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-FS</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--filesync</B>

Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.
Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed
files are updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not
deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new mode that checks
entries in the archive against the file system.  If the file time and
file size of the entry matches that of the OS file, the entry is
copied from the old archive instead of being read from the file system
and compressed.  If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and
compressed as usual.  If the entry in the archive does not match a
file on the OS, the entry is deleted.  Enabling this option should
create archives that are the same as new archives, but since existing
entries are copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive
with <B>-FS</B> can be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also
consider using <B>-u</B> for updating an archive.
<DT><DD>
For this option to work, the archive should be updated from the same
directory it was created in so the relative paths match.  If few files
are being copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a
new archive instead.
<DT><DD>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly.  A
change in timezone since the original archive was created could
result in no times matching and recompression of all files.
<DT><DD>
This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to preserve
the original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use the
<B>--out</B> option to output the updated archive to a new file.
Even though it may be slower, creating a new archive with a new archive
name is safer, avoids mismatches between archive and OS paths, and
is preferred.

<B>--grow &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>

Grow (append to) the specified

<I>zip</I>

attempts to restore the archive to its original state. If the restoration
fails, the archive might become corrupted. This option is ignored when
there's no existing archive or when at least one archive member must be

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i \*.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include only the files that end in
<I></I>.c

in the current directory and its subdirectories. (Note for PKZIP
users: the equivalent command is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
pkzip -rP foo *.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
PKZIP does not allow recursion in directories other than the current one.)
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
<I>zip</I>

at all directory levels.
[This is for Unix and other systems where \  escapes the
next character.  For other systems where the shell does not
process * do not use \ and the above is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i *.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Examples are for Unix unless otherwise specified.]  So to include dir,
a directory directly under the current directory, use
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i dir/\*
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
or
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i &quot;dir/*&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
to match paths such as dir/a and dir/b/file.c [on
ports without wildcard expansion in the shell such as MSDOS and Windows
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i dir/*
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
is used.]  Note that currently the trailing / is needed
for directories (as in
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i dir/
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
to include directory dir).
<DT><DD>
The long option form of the first example is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . --include \*.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
and does the same thing as the short option form.
<DT><DD>
Though the command syntax used to require <B>-i</B> at
the end of the command line, this version actually
allows <B>-i</B> (or <B>--include</B>) anywhere.  The
list of files terminates at the next argument starting
with <B>-</B>, the end of the command line, or the list
terminator <B>@</B> (an argument that is just @).  So
the above can be given as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -i \*.c @ -r foo .
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
for example.  There must be a space between
the option and the first file of a list.  For just
one file you can use the single value form
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -i\*.c -r foo .
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
(no space between option and value) or
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip --include=\*.c -r foo .
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
as additional examples.  The single value forms are
not recommended because they can be confusing and,
in particular, the <B>-ifile</B> format can cause
problems if the first letter of <B>file</B> combines with
<B>i</B> to form a two-letter option starting with
<B>i</B>.  Use <B>-sc</B> to see how your command line
will be parsed.
<DT><DD>
Also possible:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo  . <A HREF="mailto:-i@include.lst">-i@include.lst</A>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will only include the files in the current directory and its
subdirectories that match the patterns in the file include.lst.

[Acorn RISC OS] Don't scan through Image files.  When used, <I>zip</I> will not
consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions or Spark archives when SparkFS
is loaded) as directories but will store them as single files.
<P>
For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive will result
in a zipfile containing a directory (and its content) while using the 'I'

<B>--ignore-case</B>

[VMS, WIN32] Ignore case when matching archive entries.  This option is
only available on systems where the case of files is ignored.  On systems
with case-insensitive file systems, case is normally ignored when matching files
on the file system but is not ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy),
and similar modes when matching against archive entries (currently -f
ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems where
case does matter and names that are the same except for case can exist

This option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for PKUNZIP
under MSDOS. If the input files already contain CR LF, this option adds
an extra CR. This is to ensure that

This option can be used on MSDOS if the zip file is intended for unzip
under Unix.  If the file is converted and the file is later determined
to be binary a warning is issued and the file is probably
corrupted.  In this release if <B>-ll</B> detects binary in the first buffer
read from a file, <I>zip</I> now issues a warning and skips line end
conversion on the file.  This check seems to catch all binary files
tested, but the original check remains and if a converted file is
later determined to be binary that warning is still issued.  A new algorithm
is now being used for binary detection that should allow line end conversion
of text files in <B>UTF-8</B> and similar encodings.

<DT>

<B>--move &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>

Move the specified files into the
<I>zip</I>

archive; actually,
this deletes the target directories/files after making the specified
<I>zip</I>

archive. If a directory becomes empty after removal of the files, the
directory is also removed. No deletions are done until
<I>zip</I>

has created the archive without error.
This is useful for conserving disk space,
but is potentially dangerous so it is recommended to use it in
combination with
<B>-T</B>

to test the archive before removing all input files.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-MM</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--must-match</B>

All input patterns must match at least one file and all input files
found must be readable.  Normally when an input pattern does not match
a file the &quot;name not matched&quot; warning is issued and when an input file
has been found but later is missing or not readable a missing or not
readable warning is issued.  In either case
<I>zip</I>

continues creating the archive, with missing or unreadable new files
being skipped and files already in the archive remaining unchanged.
After the archive is created, if any files were not readable
<I>zip</I>

returns the OPEN error code (18 on most systems) instead of the normal
success return (0 on most systems).  With <B>-MM</B> set,
<I>zip</I>

exits as soon as an input pattern is not matched (whenever the
&quot;name not matched&quot; warning would be issued) or when an input file is
not readable.  In either case <I>zip</I> exits with an OPEN error
and no archive is created.
<DT><DD>
This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so
any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.  It is less
useful when used with wildcards, but <I>zip</I> will still exit with an
error if any input pattern doesn't match at least one file and if any
matched files are unreadable.  If you want to create the archive
anyway and only need to know if files were skipped, don't use
<B>-MM</B>

and just check the return code.  Also <B>-lf</B> could be useful.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-n&nbsp;</B>suffixes

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--suffixes&nbsp;</B>suffixes

Do not attempt to compress files named with the given
<B>suffixes</B>.
Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
so that
<I>zip</I>

doesn't waste its time trying to compress them.
The suffixes are separated by
either colons or semicolons.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will copy everything from
<I>foo</I>

into
<I>foo.zip</I>,

but will store any files that end in
<I>.Z</I>,

<I>.zip</I>,

<I>.tiff</I>,

<I>.gif</I>,

or
<I>.snd</I>

without trying to compress them
(image and sound files often have their own specialized compression methods).
By default,
<I>zip</I>

does not compress files with extensions in the list
<I>.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.</I>

Such files are stored directly in the output archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with csh:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
setenv ZIPOPT &quot;-n .gif:.zip&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
To attempt compression on all files, use:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -n : foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The maximum compression option
<B>-9</B>

also attempts compression on all files regardless of extension.
<DT><DD>
On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes (3 hex digit
format). By default, <I>zip</I> does not compress files with filetypes in the list
DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files and PackDir files).
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-nw</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--no-wild</B>

Do not perform internal wildcard processing (shell processing of wildcards is still done
by the shell unless the arguments are escaped).  Useful if a list of paths is being
read and no wildcard substitution is desired.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-N</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--notes</B>

[Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS filenotes as zipfile comments. They can be
restored by using the -N option of <I>unzip</I>. If -c is used also, you are
prompted for comments only for those files that do not have filenotes.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-o</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--latest-time</B>

Set the &quot;last modified&quot; time of the
<I>zip</I>

archive to the latest (oldest) &quot;last modified&quot; time
found among the entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
This can be used without any other operations, if desired.
For example:
<DT><DD>
zip -o foo
<DT><DD>
will change the last modified time of
<B>foo.zip</B>
to the latest time of the entries in
<B>foo.zip</B>.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-O </B>output-file

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--output-file </B>output-file

Process the archive changes as usual, but instead of updating the existing archive,
output the new archive to output-file.  Useful for updating an archive
without changing the existing archive and the input archive must be a different file
than the output archive.
<P>
This option can be used to create updated split archives.
It can also be used with <B>-U</B> to copy entries from an existing archive to a new
archive.  See the <B>EXAMPLES</B> section below.
<P>
Another use is converting <I>zip</I> files from one split size to another.  For instance,
to convert an archive with 700 MB CD splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which uses copy mode.  See <B>-U</B> below.  Also:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.
<P>
Copy mode will convert stream entries (using data descriptors and which
should be compatible with most unzips) to normal entries (which should
be compatible
with all unzips), except if standard encryption was used.  For archives
with encrypted entries, <I>zipcloak</I> will decrypt the entries and convert
them to normal entries.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-p</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--paths</B>

Include relative file paths as part of the names of files stored in the archive.
This is the default.  The <B>-j</B> option junks the paths and just stores the
names of the files.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-P&nbsp;</B>password

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--password&nbsp;</B>password

Use <I>password</I> to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  <B>THIS IS
INSECURE!</B>  Many multi-user operating systems provide ways for any user to
see the current command line of any other user; even on stand-alone systems
there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext
password as part of a command line in an automated script is even worse.
Whenever possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.
(And where security is truly important, use strong encryption such as Pretty
Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak standard encryption provided by
zipfile utilities.)
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-q</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--quiet</B>

Quiet mode;

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-Q</B>n

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--Q-flag&nbsp;</B>n

[QDOS] store information about the file in the file header with n defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  0: Don't add headers for any file
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  1: Add headers for all files
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-r</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--recurse-paths</B>

Travel the directory structure recursively;
for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo.zip foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
or more concisely
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In this case, all the files and directories in
<B>foo</B>

are saved in a
<I>zip</I>

archive named <B>foo.zip</B>,
including files with names starting with <B>&quot;.&quot;</B>,
since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name substitution mechanism.
If you wish to include only a specific subset of the files in directory
<B>foo</B>
and its subdirectories, use the
<B>-i</B>
option to specify the pattern of files to be included.
You should not use
<B>-r</B>
with the name <B>&quot;.*&quot;</B>,
since that matches <B>&quot;..&quot;</B>
which will attempt to zip up the parent directory
(probably not what was intended).
<DT><DD>
Multiple source directories are allowed as in
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo1 foo2
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which first zips up <B>foo1</B> and then <B>foo2</B>, going down each directory.
<DT><DD>
Note that while wildcards to <B>-r</B> are typically resolved while recursing down
directories in the file system, any <B>-R</B>, <B>-x</B>, and <B>-i</B> wildcards
are applied to internal archive pathnames once the directories are scanned.
To have wildcards apply to files in subdirectories when recursing on
Unix and similar systems where the shell does wildcard substitution, either
escape all wildcards or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.  This lets
<I>zip</I> see the wildcards and match files in subdirectories using them as
it recurses.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-R</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--recurse-patterns</B>

Travel the directory structure recursively starting at the
current directory;
for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -R foo &quot;*.c&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In this case, all the files matching <B>*.c</B> in the tree starting at the
current directory are stored into a
<I>zip</I>

archive named
<B>foo.zip</B>.
Note that <B>*.c</B> will match <B>file.c</B>, <B>a/file.c</B>
and <B>a/b/.c</B>.  More than one pattern can be listed as separate
arguments.
Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
pkzip -rP foo *.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Patterns are relative file paths as they appear in the archive, or will after
zipping, and can have optional wildcards in them.  For example, given
the current directory is <B>foo</B> and under it are directories <B>foo1</B> and <B>foo2</B>
and in <B>foo1</B> is the file <B>bar.c</B>,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -R foo/*
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will zip up <B>foo</B>, <B>foo/foo1</B>, <B>foo/foo1/bar.c</B>, and <B>foo/foo2</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -R */bar.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will zip up <B>foo/foo1/bar.c</B>.  See the note for <B>-r</B> on escaping wildcards.
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-RE</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--regex</B>

[WIN32]  Before <I>zip</I> <I>3.0</I>, regular expression list matching was
enabled by default on Windows platforms.  Because of confusion resulting
from the need to escape &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; in names, it is now off by default for
Windows so &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; are just normal characters in names.  This option
enables [] matching again.
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-s&nbsp;</B>splitsize

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--split-size&nbsp;</B>splitsize

Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split archive is an archive
that could be split over many files.  As the archive is created, if the size of the
archive reaches the specified split size, that split is closed and the next split
opened.  In general all splits but the last will be the split size and the last
will be whatever is left.  If the entire archive is smaller than the split size a
single-file archive is created.
<P>
Split archives are stored in numbered files.  For example, if the output
archive is named <B>archive</B> and three splits are required, the resulting
archive will be in the three files <B>archive.z01</B>, <B>archive.z02</B>, and
<B>archive.zip</B>.  Do not change the numbering of these files or the archive
will not be readable as these are used to determine the order the splits are read.
<P>
Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier.  Currently the
number must be an integer.  The multiplier can currently be one of
<B>k</B> (kilobytes), <B>m</B> (megabytes), <B>g</B> (gigabytes), or <B>t</B>
(terabytes).  As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers without multipliers
default to megabytes.  For example, to create a split archive called <B>foo</B>
with the contents of the <B>bar</B> directory with splits of 670 MB that might
be useful for burning on CDs, the command:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -s 670m -r foo bar
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
could be used.
<P>
Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new
archive, but they can be specifically excluded.  If possible, keep
the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when creating
split archives.
<P>
Using <B>-s</B> without <B>-sp</B> as above creates all the splits where
<B>foo</B> is being written, in this case the current directory.  This split
mode updates the splits as the archive is being created, requiring all
splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are readable by
any unzip that supports split archives.  See <B>-sp</B> below for enabling
split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to removable
media.
<P>
The option <B>-sv</B> can be used to enable verbose splitting and provide details of
how the splitting is being done.  The <B>-sb</B> option can be used to ring the bell
when <I>zip</I> pauses for the next split destination.
<P>
Split archives cannot be updated, but see the <B>-O</B> (<B>--out</B>) option for
how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new archive.
A split archive can also be converted into a single-file archive using a
split size of 0 or negating the <B>-s</B> option:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Also see <B>-U</B> (<B>--copy</B>) for more on using copy mode.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-sb</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--split-bell</B>

If splitting and using split pause mode, ring the bell when <I>zip</I> pauses
for each split destination.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-sc</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--show-command</B>

Show the command line starting <I>zip</I> as processed and exit.  The new command parser
permutes the arguments, putting all options and any values associated with them
before any non-option arguments.  This allows an option to appear anywhere in the
command line as long as any values that go with the option go with it.  This option
displays the command line as <I>zip</I> sees it, including any arguments from
the environment such as from the <B>ZIPOPT</B> variable.  Where allowed, options later
in the command line can override options earlier in the command line.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-sf</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--show-files</B>

Show the files that would be operated on, then exit.  For instance, if creating
a new archive, this will list the files that would be added.  If the option is
negated, <B>-sf-</B>, output only to an open log file.  Screen display is
not recommended for large lists.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-so</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--show-options</B>

Show all available options supported by <I>zip</I> as compiled on the current system.
As this command reads the option table, it should include all options.  Each line
includes the short option (if defined), the long option (if defined), the format
of any value that goes with the option, if the option can be negated, and a
small description.  The value format can be no value, required value, optional
value, single character value, number value, or a list of values.  The output of
this option is not intended to show how to use any option but only
show what options are available.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-sp</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--split-pause</B>

If splitting is enabled with <B>-s</B>, enable split pause mode.  This
creates split archives as <B>-s</B> does, but stream writing is used so each
split can be closed as soon as it is written and <I>zip</I> will pause between each
split to allow changing split destination or media.
<P>
Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to removable media, it
uses stream archive format that may not be readable by some unzips.  Before
relying on splits created with <B>-sp</B>, test a split archive with the unzip
you will be using.
<P>
To convert a stream split archive (created with <B>-sp</B>) to a standard archive
see the <B>--out</B> option.
<DT>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-T</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>

Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the old zip file
is unchanged and (with the
<B>-m</B>

option) no input files are removed.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-TT&nbsp;</B>cmd

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--unzip-command&nbsp;</B>cmd

Use command cmd instead of 'unzip -tqq' to test an archive when the <B>-T</B>
option is used.  On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the current directory instead
of the standard system unzip, could use:
<DT><DD>
 zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT &quot;./unzip -tqq&quot;
<DT><DD>
In cmd, {} is replaced by the name of the temporary archive, otherwise the name
of the archive is appended to the end of the command.
The return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-u</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--update</B>

Replace (update) an existing entry in the
<I>zip</I>

archive only if it has been modified more recently
than the version already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -u stuff *
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will add any new files in the current directory,
and update any files which have been modified since the
<I>zip</I>

archive
<I>stuff.zip</I>

was last created/modified (note that
<I>zip</I>

will not try to pack
<I>stuff.zip</I>

into itself when you do this).
<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>-u</B>

option with no input file arguments acts like the
<B>-f</B>

(freshen) option.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-U</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--copy-entries</B>

Copy entries from one archive to another.  Requires the <B>--out</B>
option to specify a different output file than the input archive.  Copy
mode is the reverse of <B>-d</B> delete.  When delete is being used
with <B>--out</B>, the selected entries are deleted from the archive
and all other entries are copied to the new archive, while copy mode
selects the files to include in the new archive.  Unlike <B>-u</B>
update, input patterns on the command line are matched against archive
entries only and not the file system files.  For instance,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip inarchive &quot;*.c&quot; --copy --out outarchive
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
copies entries with names ending in <B>.c</B> from <B>inarchive</B>
to <B>outarchive</B>.  The wildcard must be escaped on some systems
to prevent the shell from substituting names of files from the
file system which may have no relevance to the entries in the archive.
<P>
If no input files appear on the command line and <B>--out</B> is
used, copy mode is assumed:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip inarchive --out outarchive
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
This is useful for changing split size for instance.  Encrypting
and decrypting entries is not yet supported using copy mode.  Use
<I>zipcloak</I> for that.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-UN&nbsp;</B>v

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--unicode&nbsp;</B>v

Determine what <I>zip</I> should do with Unicode file names.
<I>zip&nbsp;3.0</I>, in addition to the standard file path, now
includes the UTF-8 translation of the path if the entry path
is not entirely 7-bit ASCII.  When an entry
is missing the Unicode path, <I>zip</I> reverts back to the
standard file path.  The problem with using the standard path
is this path is in the local character set of the zip that created
the entry, which may contain characters that are not valid in
the character set being used by the unzip.  When <I>zip</I> is
reading an archive, if an entry also has a Unicode path,
<I>zip</I> now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate
the standard path using the current local character set.
<P>
This option can be used to determine what <I>zip</I> should do
with this path if there is a mismatch between the stored standard path
and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard path was
updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is
assumed that the standard path is more current and
<I>zip</I> uses that.  Values for <B>v</B> are
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
q - quit if paths do not match
<DT><DD>
w - warn, continue with standard path
<DT><DD>
i - ignore, continue with standard path
<DT><DD>
n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The default is to warn and continue.
<P>
Characters that are not valid in the current character set are
escaped as <B>#Uxxxx</B> and <B>#Lxxxxxx</B>, where x is an
ASCII character for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit
character number is sufficient to represent the Unicode character
and the second if the character needs more than 16 bits to
represent it's Unicode character code.  Setting <B>-UN</B> to
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
e - escape
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
as in
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive -sU -UN=e
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
forces <I>zip</I> to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit
ASCII.
<P>
Normally <I>zip</I> stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field
on systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores the
UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
u - UTF-8
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
as in
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
forces <I>zip</I> to store UTF-8 as native in the archive.  Note that
storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that support it.
This option could be useful on Windows systems where the escaped
path is too large to be a valid path and the UTF-8 version of the
path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not backward compatible on
Windows systems.
<P>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-v</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--verbose</B>

Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.
<DT><DD>
Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the display of a
progress indicator during compression (see <B>-dd</B> for more on dots) and
requests verbose diagnostic info about zipfile structure oddities.
<DT><DD>
However, when
<B>-v</B>

is the only command line argument a diagnostic screen is printed instead.  This
should now work even if stdout is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving
of the information for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.  The version
screen provides the help screen header with program name, version, and release
date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home and distribution sites, and shows
information about the target environment (compiler type and version, OS
version, compilation date and the enabled optional features used to create the
<I>zip</I>

executable).
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-V</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--VMS-portable</B>

[VMS] Save VMS file attributes.
(Files are  truncated at EOF.)   When a -V archive is unpacked on a
non-VMS system,  some file types (notably Stream_LF
text files  and  pure binary files  like fixed-512)
should be extracted intact.  Indexed files and file
types with embedded record sizes (notably variable-length record types)
will probably be seen as corrupt elsewhere.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-VV</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--VMS-specific</B>

[VMS] Save VMS file attributes, and  all allocated
blocks in a file,  including  any  data beyond EOF.
Useful for moving ill-formed files  among  VMS systems.   When a -VV archive is
unpacked on a non-VMS system, almost all files will appear corrupt.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-w</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--VMS-versions</B>

[VMS] Append the version number of the files to the name,
including multiple versions of files.  Default is to use only
the most recent version of a specified file.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-ww</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--VMS-dot-versions</B>

[VMS] Append the version number of the files to the name,
including multiple versions of files, using the .nnn format.
Default is to use only the most recent version of a specified
file.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-ws</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--wild-stop-dirs</B>

Wildcards match only at a directory level.  Normally <I>zip</I> handles
paths as strings and given the paths
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
/foo/bar/dir/file1.c
<DT><DD>
/foo/bar/file2.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
an input pattern such as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
/foo/bar/*
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
normally would match both paths, the * matching <B>dir/file1.c</B>
and <B>file2.c</B>.  Note that in the first case a directory
boundary (/) was crossed in the match.  With <B>-ws</B> no
directory bounds will be included in the match, making
wildcards local to a specific directory level.  So, with
<B>-ws</B> enabled, only the second path would be matched.
<P>
When using <B>-ws</B>, use ** to match across directory boundaries as
* does normally.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-x&nbsp;</B>files

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--exclude&nbsp;</B>files

Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo -x \*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include the contents of
<B>foo</B>

in
<B>foo.zip</B>

while excluding all the files that end in
<B>.o</B>.
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
<I>zip</I>

at all directory levels.
<DT><DD>
Also possible:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo <A HREF="mailto:-x@exclude.lst">-x@exclude.lst</A>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include the contents of
<B>foo</B>

in
<B>foo.zip</B>

while excluding all the files that match the patterns in the file
<B>exclude.lst</B>.
<DT><DD>
The long option forms of the above are
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo --exclude \*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
and
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo -x \*.o \*.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
If there is no space between <B>-x</B> and
the pattern, just one value is assumed (no list):
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo -x\*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<DT><DD>
See <B>-i</B> for more on include and exclude.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-X</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--no-extra</B>

Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid
and file times on Unix).  The zip format uses extra fields to include
additional information for each entry.  Some extra fields are specific
to particular systems while others are applicable to all systems.
Normally when <I>zip</I> reads entries from an existing archive, it
reads the extra fields it knows, strips the rest, and adds
the extra fields applicable to that system.  With <B>-X</B>, <I>zip</I> strips
all old fields and only includes the Unicode and Zip64 extra fields
(currently these two extra fields cannot be disabled).
<P>
Negating this option, <B>-X-</B>, includes all the default extra fields,
but also copies over any unrecognized extra fields.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-y</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--symlinks</B>

For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as such in the
<I>zip</I>

archive, instead of compressing and storing the file referred to by
the link.  This can avoid multiple copies of files being included in
the archive as <I>zip</I> recurses the directory trees and accesses
files directly and by links.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-z</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--archive-comment</B>

Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire
<I>zip</I>

archive.
The comment is ended by a line containing just a period,
or an end of file condition (^D on Unix, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS).
The comment can be taken from a file:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -z foo &lt; foowhat
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>-Z&nbsp;</B>cm

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--compression-method&nbsp;</B>cm

Set the default compression method.  Currently the main methods supported
by <I>zip</I> are <B>store</B> and <B>deflate</B>.  Compression method
can be set to:
<P>
<B>store</B> - Setting the compression method to <B>store</B> forces
<I>zip</I> to store entries with no compression.  This is generally
faster than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.
This is the same as using <B>-0</B> (compression level zero).
<P>
<B>deflate</B> - This is the default method for <I>zip</I>.  If <I>zip</I>
determines that storing is better than deflation, the entry will be
stored instead.
<P>
<B>bzip2</B> - If <B>bzip2</B> support is compiled in, this compression
method also becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently support
the <B>bzip2</B> compression method, so test the unzip you will be using
before relying on archives using this method (compression method 12).
<P>
For example, to add <B>bar.c</B> to archive <B>foo</B> using <B>bzip2</B>
compression:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The compression method can be abbreviated:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -Zb foo bar.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-#</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>(-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)</B>

Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
<B>#</B>,

where
<B>-0</B>

indicates no compression (store all files),
<B>-1</B>

indicates the fastest compression speed (less compression)
and
<B>-9</B>

indicates the slowest compression speed (optimal compression, ignores
the suffix list). The default compression level is
<B>-6.</B>

<P>
Though still being worked, the intention is this setting will control
compression speed for all compression methods.  Currently only
deflation is controlled.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-!</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--use-privileges</B>

[WIN32] Use priviliges (if granted) to obtain all aspects of WinNT security.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-@</B>

<DT>

<B>--names-stdin</B>

Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one filename per line.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-$</B>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>--volume-label</B>

[MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32] Include the volume label for the drive holding
the first file to be compressed.  If you want to include only the volume
label or to force a specific drive, use the drive name as first file name,
as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -$ foo a: c:bar
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

The simplest example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip stuff *
</DL>
<P>

creates the archive
<I>stuff.zip</I>

(assuming it does not exist)
and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form
(the
<B>.zip</B>
suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains
a dot already;
this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).
<P>

Because of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution,
files starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included;
to include these as well:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip stuff .* *
</DL>
<P>

Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.
<P>

To zip up an entire directory, the command:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
<P>

creates the archive
<I>foo.zip</I>,

containing all the files and directories in the directory
<I>foo</I>

that is contained within the current directory.
<P>

You may want to make a
<I>zip</I>

archive that contains the files in
<I>foo</I>,

without recording the directory name,
<I>foo</I>.

You can use the
<B>-j</B>

option to leave off the paths,
as in:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -j foo foo/*
</DL>
<P>

If you are short on disk space,
you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory
and the corresponding compressed
<I>zip</I>

archive.
In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
<B>-m</B>

option.
If
<I>foo</I>

contains the subdirectories
<I>tom</I>,

<I>dick</I>,

and
<I>harry</I>,

you can:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rm foo foo/tom
<BR>

zip -rm foo foo/dick
<BR>

zip -rm foo foo/harry
</DL>
<P>

where the first command creates
<I>foo.zip</I>,

and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each
<I>zip</I>

command,
the last created archive is deleted,
making room for the next
<I>zip</I>

command to function.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>

Use <B>-s</B> to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is given as
a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB).
The command
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo
</DL>
<P>

creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than 2&nbsp;GB each.  If
foo contained 5&nbsp;GB of contents and the contents were stored in the split archive without
compression (to make this example simple), this would create three splits, split.z01 at 2&nbsp;GB,
split.z02 at 2&nbsp;GB, and split.zip at a little over 1&nbsp;GB.
<P>

The <B>-sp</B> option can be used to pause <I>zip</I> between splits to allow changing
removable media, for example, but read the descriptions and warnings for both <B>-s</B>
and <B>-sp</B> below.
<P>

Though <I>zip</I> does not update split archives, <I>zip</I> provides the new option <B>-O</B>
(<B>--output-file</B>) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new archive.  For example,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip
</DL>
<P>

reads archive <B>inarchive.zip</B>, even if split, adds the files <B>foo.c</B> and
<B>bar.c</B>, and writes the resulting archive to <B>outarchive.zip</B>.  If
<B>inarchive.zip</B> is split then <B>outarchive.zip</B> defaults
to the same split size.  Be aware that <B>outarchive.zip</B> and any split files
that are created with it are always overwritten without warning.  This may be changed
in the future.

<H2>PATTERN MATCHING</H2>

This section applies only to Unix.
Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.
However, the special wildcard characters <B>*</B> and <B>[]</B> below apply
to at least MSDOS also.
<P>

The Unix shells (<I>sh</I>, <I>csh</I>, <I>bash</I>, and others) normally
do filename substitution (also called &quot;globbing&quot;) on command arguments.
Generally the special characters are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>?</B>

<DD>
match any single character
<DT><B>*</B>

<DD>
match any number of characters (including none)
<DT><B>[]</B>

<DD>
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets
(example: [a-f], [0-9]).  This form of wildcard matching
allows a user to specify a list of characters between square brackets and
if any of the characters match the expression matches.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive &quot;*.[hc]&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
would archive all files in the current directory that end in
<B>.h</B> or <B>.c</B>.
<P>
Ranges of characters are supported:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive &quot;[a-f]*&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
would add to the archive all files starting with &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot;.
<P>
Negation is also supported, where any character in that position not in
the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding <B>!</B> or <B>^</B>
to the beginning of the list:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip archive &quot;*.[!o]&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
matches files that don't end in &quot;.o&quot;.
<P>
On WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option to avoid
the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

When these characters are encountered
(without being escaped with a backslash or quotes),
the shell will look for files relative to the current path
that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.
<P>

The
<I>zip</I>

program can do the same matching on names that are in the
<I>zip</I>

archive being modified or,
in the case of the
<B>-x</B>

(exclude) or
<B>-i</B>

(include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
In general, when
<I>zip</I>

encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in
the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.
If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the
<I>zip</I>

archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters
described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the
list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the
<B>-x</B>

option, or does not match any name given with the
<B>-i</B>

option.
<P>

The pattern matching includes the path,
and so patterns like \*.o match names that end in &quot;.o&quot;,
no matter what the path prefix is.
Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]),
or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).
<P>

In general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths
that have wildcards to make
<I>zip</I>

do the pattern matching for file paths, and always for
paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for
<B>-i</B>, <B>-x</B>, <B>-R</B>, <B>-d</B>, and <B>-U</B>
and anywhere <I>zip</I> needs to process the wildcards.

VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking
things, so <I>zip</I> instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  In
general, <I>zip</I> sets VMS Facility = 1955 (0x07A3), Code = 2* Unix_status,
and an appropriate Severity (as specified in ziperr.h).  More details are
included in the VMS-specific documentation.  See [.vms]NOTES.TXT and

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<I>zip</I>

3.0 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
<I>zip</I>

1.1 to produce
<I>zip</I>

files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
<P>

<I>zip</I>

files produced by
<I>zip</I>

3.0 must not be
<I>updated</I>

by
<I>zip</I>

1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of
<I>zip</I>

or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.
The old versions can list the contents of the zip file
but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do
not have to care about this problem.
<P>

Under VMS,
not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
Only stream-LF format
<I>zip</I>

files are expected to work with
<I>zip</I>.

Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.
This version of
<I>zip</I>

handles some of the conversion internally.
When using Kermit to transfer zip files from VMS to MSDOS, type &quot;set
file type block&quot; on VMS.  When transfering from MSDOS to VMS, type
&quot;set file type fixed&quot; on VMS.  In both cases, type &quot;set file type
binary&quot; on MSDOS.
<P>

Under some older VMS versions, <I>zip</I> may hang for file
specifications that use DECnet syntax
<I>foo::*.*.</I>

<P>

On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the
32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such
as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.
<P>

Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different
EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's
a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability
to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by
<I>zip</I>

(which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.
<I>zip</I>

stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit
MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the
32-bit-mode size.

<H2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</H2>

Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
<I>Shrink.Pas</I>

program, which inspired this project,
and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen;
to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the
<I>zip</I>

file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for
clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid
Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression
algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
Adler for providing a mailing list and
<I>ftp</I>

site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
<I>infozip.who</I>)

without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
<I>zip</I>

would not have been possible.
Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator,
David Kirschbaum,
for getting us into this mess in the first place.
The manual page was rewritten for Unix by R. P. C. Rodgers and
updated by E. Gordon for <I>zip</I> 3.0.
