<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This tool is part of the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+samba">samba</A></B>(7)
suite.
<P>

The
smbcacls
program manipulates NT Access Control Lists (ACLs) on SMB file shares.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The following options are available to the
smbcacls
program. The format of ACLs is described in the section ACL FORMAT
<P>

-a|--add acls
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Add the ACLs specified to the ACL list. Existing access control entries are unchanged.
</DL>

<P>

-M|--modify acls
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Modify the mask value (permissions) for the ACLs specified on the command line. An error will be printed for each ACL specified that was not already present in the ACL list
</DL>

<P>

-D|--delete acls
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Delete any ACLs specified on the command line. An error will be printed for each ACL specified that was not already present in the ACL list.
</DL>

<P>

-S|--set acls
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This command sets the ACLs on the file with only the ones specified on the command line. All other ACLs are erased. Note that the ACL specified must contain at least a revision, type, owner and group for the call to succeed.
</DL>

<P>

-C|--chown name
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name given using the
<I>-C</I>
option. The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified in the first argument.
<P>
This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name.
</DL>

<P>

-G|--chgrp name
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The group owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name given using the
<I>-G</I>
option. The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified n the first argument.
<P>
This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.
</DL>

<P>

--numeric
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This option displays all ACL information in numeric format. The default is to convert SIDs to names and ACE types and masks to a readable string format.
</DL>

<P>

-t|--test-args
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Don't actually do anything, only validate the correctness of the arguments.
</DL>

<P>

-h|--help
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Print a summary of command line options.
</DL>

<P>

-d|--debuglevel=level
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>level</I>
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0.
<P>
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
<P>
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
<P>
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
m[blue]<B>smb.conf.5.html#</B>m[]
parameter in the
smb.conf
file.
</DL>

<P>

-V|--version
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Prints the program version number.
</DL>

<P>

-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
smb.conf
for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
</DL>

<P>

-l|--log-basename=logdirectory
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
<B>&quot;.progname&quot;</B>
will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
</DL>

<P>

-N|--no-pass
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.
<P>
Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.
<P>
If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently ingnored and no password will be used.
</DL>

<P>

-k|--kerberos
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.
</DL>

<P>

-C|--use-ccache
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Try to use the credentials cached by winbind.
</DL>

<P>

-A|--authentication-file=filename
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection. The format of the file is
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
username = &lt;value&gt;
password = &lt;value&gt;
domain   = &lt;value&gt;
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.
</DL>

<P>

-U|--user=username[%password]
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Sets the SMB username or username and password.
<P>
If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the
<B>USER</B>
environment variable, then the
<B>LOGNAME</B>
variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not found, the username
<B>GUEST</B>
is used.
<P>
A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the
<I>-A</I>
for more details.
<P>
Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a running process may be seen via the
ps
command. To be safe always allow
rpcclient
to prompt for a password and type it in directly.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ACL FORMAT</H2>

<P>

The format of an ACL is one or more ACL entries separated by either commas or newlines. An ACL entry is one of the following:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
 
REVISION:&lt;revision number&gt;
OWNER:&lt;sid or name&gt;
GROUP:&lt;sid or name&gt;
ACL:&lt;sid or name&gt;:&lt;type&gt;/&lt;flags&gt;/&lt;mask&gt;
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>

The revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT ACL revision for the security descriptor. If not specified it defaults to 1. Using values other than 1 may cause strange behaviour.
<P>

The owner and group specify the owner and group sids for the object. If a SID in the format S-1-x-y-z is specified this is used, otherwise the name specified is resolved using the server on which the file or directory resides.
<P>

ACLs specify permissions granted to the SID. This SID again can be specified in S-1-x-y-z format or as a name in which case it is resolved against the server on which the file or directory resides. The type, flags and mask values determine the type of access granted to the SID.
<P>

The type can be either ALLOWED or DENIED to allow/deny access to the SID. The flags values are generally zero for file ACLs and either 9 or 2 for directory ACLs. Some common flags are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<B>#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT 0x1</B>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<B>#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT 0x2</B>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<B>#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT 0x4</B>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<B>#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY 0x8</B>
<P>
</DL>

<P>

At present flags can only be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values.
<P>

The mask is a value which expresses the access right granted to the SID. It can be given as a decimal or hexadecimal value, or by using one of the following text strings which map to the NT file permissions of the same name.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>R</I>
- Allow read access
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>W</I>
- Allow write access
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>X</I>
- Execute permission on the object
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>D</I>
- Delete the object
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>P</I>
- Change permissions
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>O</I>
- Take ownership
<P>
</DL>

<P>

The following combined permissions can be specified:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>READ</I>
- Equivalent to 'RX' permissions
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>CHANGE</I>
- Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


<I>FULL</I>
- Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' permissions
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

<P>

The
smbcacls
program sets the exit status depending on the success or otherwise of the operations performed. The exit status may be one of the following values.
<P>

If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit status of 0. If
smbcacls
couldn't connect to the specified server, or there was an error getting or setting the ACLs, an exit status of 1 is returned. If there was an error parsing any command line arguments, an exit status of 2 is returned.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSION</H2>

<P>

This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AUTHOR</H2>

<P>

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
<P>

smbcacls
was written by Andrew Tridgell and Tim Potter.
<P>

The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
