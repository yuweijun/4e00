<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>compile_et</B>

file

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Compile_et</B>

converts a table listing error-code names and associated messages into
a C source file suitable for use with the
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+com_err">com_err</A></I>(3)

library.
<P>
The source file name must end with a suffix of ``.et''; the file
consists of a declaration supplying the name (up to four characters
long) of the error-code table:
<P>
<B>error_table</B>

<I>name</I>

<P>
followed by up to 256 entries of the form:
<P>
<B>error_code</B>

<I>name,</I>

&quot;
<I>string</I>

&quot;
<P>
and a final
<P>
<B>end</B>

<P>
to indicate the end of the table.
<P>
The name of the table is used to construct the name of a subroutine
<I>initialize_XXXX_error_table</I>

which must be called in order for the
<I>com_err</I>

library to recognize the error table.
<P>
The various error codes defined are assigned sequentially increasing
numbers (starting with a large number computed as a hash function of
the name of the table); thus for compatibility it is suggested that
new codes be added only to the end of an existing table, and that no
codes be removed from tables.
<P>
The names defined in the table are placed into a C header file with
preprocessor directives defining them as integer constants of up to
32 bits in magnitude.
<P>
A C source file is also generated which should be compiled and linked
with the object files which reference these error codes; it contains
the text of the messages and the initialization subroutine.  Both C
files have names derived from that of the original source file, with
the ``.et'' suffix replaced by ``.c'' and ``.h''.
<P>
A ``#'' in the source file is treated as a comment character, and all
remaining text to the end of the source line will be ignored.
<P>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>
Since the original
<B>compile_et</B>

uses a very simple parser based on
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+yacc">yacc</A></I>(1),

and this current version of 
<B>compile_et</B>

uses an awk/sed combination of scripts, 
its error recovery leaves much to be desired.
