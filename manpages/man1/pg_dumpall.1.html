pg_dumpall - extract a PostgreSQL database cluster into a script file
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<B>pg_dumpall</B> [ <B></B><I>option</I><B></B><I>...</I> ] 
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>pg_dumpall</B> is a utility for writing out
(``dumping'') all PostgreSQL databases
of a cluster into one script file. The script file contains
SQL commands that can be used as input to <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+psql">psql</A></B>(1) to restore the databases. It does this by
calling <B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+pg_dump">pg_dump</A></B>(1) for each database in a cluster.
<B>pg_dumpall</B> also dumps global objects
that are common to all databases.
(<B>pg_dump</B> does not save these objects.)
This currently includes information about database users and
groups, tablespaces, and properties such as access permissions
that apply to databases as a whole.
<P>

Since <B>pg_dumpall</B> reads tables from all
databases you will most likely have to connect as a database
superuser in order to produce a complete dump. Also you will need
superuser privileges to execute the saved script in order to be
allowed to add users and groups, and to create databases.
<P>

The SQL script will be written to the standard output. Shell
operators should be used to redirect it into a file.
<P>

<B>pg_dumpall</B> needs to connect several
times to the PostgreSQL server (once per
database). If you use password authentication it will ask for
a password each time. It is convenient to have a
<I>~/.pgpass</I> file in such cases. See in the documentation for more information.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The following command-line options control the content and
format of the output.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
<DT><B>--data-only</B><DD>
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions).
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
<DT><B>--clean</B><DD>
Include SQL commands to clean (drop) databases before
recreating them. <B>DROP</B> commands for roles and
tablespaces are added as well.
<DT><B>-f </B><I>filename</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--file=</B><I>filename</I><B></B><DD>
Send output to the specified file. If this is omitted, the
standard output is used.
<DT><B>-g</B><DD>
<DT><B>--globals-only</B><DD>
Dump only global objects (roles and tablespaces), no databases.
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
<DT><B>--ignore-version</B><DD>
A deprecated option that is now ignored.
<DT><B>-o</B><DD>
<DT><B>--oids</B><DD>
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the
data for every table. Use this option if your application references
the OID
columns in some way (e.g., in a foreign key constraint).
Otherwise, this option should not be used.
<DT><B>-O</B><DD>
<DT><B>--no-owner</B><DD>
Do not output commands to set
ownership of objects to match the original database.
By default, <B>pg_dumpall</B> issues
<B>ALTER OWNER</B> or
<B>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</B>
statements to set ownership of created schema elements.
These statements
will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser
(or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script).
To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give
that user ownership of all the objects, specify <B>-O</B>.
<DT><B>--lock-wait-timeout=</B><I>timeout</I><B></B><DD>
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of
the dump. Instead fail if unable to lock a table within the specified
<I>timeout</I>. The timeout may be
specified in any of the formats accepted by <B>SET
statement_timeout</B>. (Allowed values vary depending on the server
version you are dumping from, but an integer number of milliseconds
is accepted by all versions since 7.3. This option is ignored when
dumping from a pre-7.3 server.)
<DT><B>--no-tablespaces</B><DD>
Do not output commands to create tablespaces nor select tablespaces
for objects.
With this option, all objects will be created in whichever
tablespace is the default during restore.
<DT><B>-r</B><DD>
<DT><B>--roles-only</B><DD>
Dump only roles, no databases or tablespaces.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
<DT><B>--schema-only</B><DD>
Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.
<DT><B>-S </B><I>username</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--superuser=</B><I>username</I><B></B><DD>
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers.
This is only relevant if <B>--disable-triggers</B> is used.
(Usually, it's better to leave this out, and instead start the
resulting script as superuser.)
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
<DT><B>--tablespaces-only</B><DD>
Dump only tablespaces, no databases or roles.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
<DT><B>--verbose</B><DD>
Specifies verbose mode. This will cause
<B>pg_dumpall</B> to output start/stop
times to the dump file, and progress messages to standard error.
It will also enable verbose output in <B>pg_dump</B>.
<DT><B>-x</B><DD>
<DT><B>--no-privileges</B><DD>
<DT><B>--no-acl</B><DD>
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).
<DT><B>--binary-upgrade</B><DD>
This option is for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its use
for other purposes is not recommended or supported. The
behavior of the option may change in future releases without
notice.
<DT><B>--inserts</B><DD>
Dump data as <B>INSERT</B> commands (rather
than <B>COPY</B>). This will make restoration very slow;
it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
non-PostgreSQL databases. Note that
the restore might fail altogether if you have rearranged column order.
The <B>--column-inserts</B> option is safer, though even
slower.
<DT><B>--column-inserts</B><DD>
<DT><B>--attribute-inserts</B><DD>
Dump data as <B>INSERT</B> commands with explicit
column names (INSERT INTO
<I>table</I>
(<I>column</I>, ...) VALUES
...). This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly
useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
non-PostgreSQL databases.
<DT><B>--disable-dollar-quoting</B><DD>
This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies,
and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string syntax.
<DT><B>--disable-triggers</B><DD>
This option is only relevant when creating a data-only dump.
It instructs <B>pg_dumpall</B> to include commands
to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while
the data is reloaded. Use this if you have referential
integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you
do not want to invoke during data reload.
<P>
Presently, the commands emitted for <B>--disable-triggers</B>
must be done as superuser. So, you should also specify
a superuser name with <B>-S</B>, or preferably be careful to
start the resulting script as a superuser.
<DT><B>--use-set-session-authorization</B><DD>
Output SQL-standard <B>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</B> commands
instead of <B>ALTER OWNER</B> commands to determine object
ownership. This makes the dump more standards compatible, but
depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might not restore
properly.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h </B><I>host</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--host=</B><I>host</I><B></B><DD>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database
server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is
used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default
is taken from the <B>PGHOST</B> environment variable,
if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.
<DT><B>-l </B><I>dbname</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--database=</B><I>dbname</I><B></B><DD>
Specifies the name of the database to connect to to dump global
objects and discover what other databases should be dumped. If
not specified, the ``postgres'' database will be used,
and if that does not exist, ``template1'' will be used.
<DT><B>-p </B><I>port</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--port=</B><I>port</I><B></B><DD>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the <B>PGPORT</B> environment variable, if
set, or a compiled-in default.
<DT><B>-U </B><I>username</I><B></B><DD>
<DT><B>--username=</B><I>username</I><B></B><DD>
User name to connect as.
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
<DT><B>--no-password</B><DD>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a <I>.pgpass</I> file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.
<DT><B>-W</B><DD>
<DT><B>--password</B><DD>
Force <B>pg_dumpall</B> to prompt for a
password before connecting to a database.
<P>
This option is never essential, since
<B>pg_dumpall</B> will automatically prompt
for a password if the server demands password authentication.
However, <B>pg_dumpall</B> will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password.
In some cases it is worth typing <B>-W</B> to avoid the extra
connection attempt.
<P>
Note that the password prompt will occur again for each database
to be dumped. Usually, it's better to set up a
<I>~/.pgpass</I> file than to rely on manual password entry.
<DT><B>--role=</B><I>rolename</I><B></B><DD>
Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump.
This option causes <B>pg_dumpall</B> to issue a
<B>SET ROLE</B> <I>rolename</I>
command after connecting to the database. It is useful when the
authenticated user (specified by <B>-U</B>) lacks privileges
needed by <B>pg_dumpall</B>, but can switch to a role with
the required rights. Some installations have a policy against
logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows
dumps to be made without violating the policy.

This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities,

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

Since <B>pg_dumpall</B> calls
<B>pg_dump</B> internally, some diagnostic
messages will refer to <B>pg_dump</B>.
<P>

Once restored, it is wise to run <B>ANALYZE</B> on each
database so the optimizer has useful statistics. You
can also run <B>vacuumdb -a -z</B> to analyze all
databases.
<P>

<B>pg_dumpall</B> requires all needed
tablespace directories to exist before the restore, else
database creation will fail for databases in non-default
locations.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

To dump all databases:
<P>
<PRE>
$ <B>pg_dumpall &gt; db.out</B>

</PRE>

<P>

To reload this database use, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
$ <B>psql -f db.out postgres</B>

</PRE>

(It is not important to which database you connect here since the
script file created by <B>pg_dumpall</B> will
contain the appropriate commands to create and connect to the saved
databases.)
