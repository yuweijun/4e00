<H3>How do I do (anything)?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Have you looked at <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> (see perlfaq2)?  The chances are that
someone has already written a module that can solve your problem.
Have you read the appropriate manpages?  Here's a brief index:

                        (not a man-page but still useful, a collection
                         of various essays on Perl techniques)

</PRE>


<P>

A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I use Perl interactively?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in the
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+perldebug">perldebug</A></I>(1) manpage, on an ``empty'' program, like this:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -de 42

</PRE>


<P>

Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately
evaluated.  You can also examine the symbol table, get stack
backtraces, check variable values, set breakpoints, and other
operations typically found in symbolic debuggers.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Is there a Perl shell?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The psh (Perl sh) is currently at version 1.8. The Perl Shell is a shell
that combines the interactive nature of a Unix shell with the power of
Perl. The goal is a full featured shell that behaves as expected for
normal shell activity and uses Perl syntax and functionality for
control-flow statements and other things. You can get psh at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/</A> .
<P>

Zoidberg is a similar project and provides a shell written in perl,
configured in perl and operated in perl. It is intended as a login shell
and development environment. It can be found at
<A HREF="http://pardus-larus.student.utwente.nl/~pardus/projects/zoidberg/">http://pardus-larus.student.utwente.nl/~pardus/projects/zoidberg/</A>
or your local <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mirror.
<P>

The Shell.pm module (distributed with Perl) makes Perl try commands
which aren't part of the Perl language as shell commands.  perlsh from
the source distribution is simplistic and uninteresting, but may still
be what you want.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I find which modules are installed on my system?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
From the command line, you can use the <TT>&quot;cpan&quot;</TT> command's <TT>&quot;-l&quot;</TT> switch:
<P>



<PRE>
        $ cpan -l

</PRE>


<P>

You can also use <TT>&quot;cpan&quot;</TT>'s <TT>&quot;-a&quot;</TT> switch to create an autobundle file
that <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> understands and cna use to re-install every module:
<P>



<PRE>
        $ cpan -a

</PRE>


<P>

Inside a Perl program, you can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to
show all installed distributions, although it can take awhile to do
its magic.  The standard library which comes with Perl just shows up
as ``Perl'' (although you can get those with Module::CoreList).
<P>



<PRE>
        use ExtUtils::Installed;

        my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new();
        my @modules = $inst-&gt;modules();

</PRE>


<P>

If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames, you
can use File::Find::Rule.
<P>



<PRE>
        use File::Find::Rule;

        my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;
                extras({follow =&gt; 1})-&gt;
                file()-&gt;
                name( '*.pm' )-&gt;
                in( @INC )
                ;

</PRE>


<P>

If you do not have that module, you can do the same thing
with File::Find which is part of the standard library.
<P>



<PRE>
        use File::Find;
        my @files;

        find(
            {
                wanted =&gt; sub {
                    push @files, $File::Find::fullname
                        if -f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp; /\.pm$/
                },
                follow =&gt; 1,
                follow_skip =&gt; 2,
            },
            @INC
        );

        print join &quot;\n&quot;, @files;

</PRE>


<P>

If you simply need to quickly check to see if a module is
available, you can check for its documentation.  If you can
read the documentation the module is most likely installed.
If you cannot read the documentation, the module might not
have any (in rare cases).
<P>



<PRE>
        $ perldoc Module::Name

</PRE>


<P>

You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to see if
perl finds it.
<P>



<PRE>
        $ perl -MModule::Name -e1

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I debug my Perl programs?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

Before you do anything else, you can help yourself by ensuring that
you let Perl tell you about problem areas in your code. By turning
on warnings and strictures, you can head off many problems before
they get too big. You can find out more about these in strict
and warnings.
<P>



<PRE>
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        use warnings;

</PRE>


<P>

Beyond that, the simplest debugger is the <TT>&quot;print&quot;</TT> function. Use it
to look at values as you run your program:
<P>



<PRE>
        print STDERR &quot;The value is [$value]\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

The <TT>&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</TT> module can pretty-print Perl data structures:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );
        print STDERR &quot;The hash is &quot; . Dumper( \%hash ) . &quot;\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

Perl comes with an interactive debugger, which you can start with the
<TT>&quot;-d&quot;</TT> switch. It's fully explained in perldebug.
<P>

If you'd like a graphical user interface and you have Tk, you can use
<TT>&quot;ptkdb&quot;</TT>. It's on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and available for free.
<P>

If you need something much more sophisticated and controllable, Leon
Brocard's Devel::ebug (which you can call with the -D switch as -Debug)
gives you the programmatic hooks into everything you need to write your
own (without too much pain and suffering).
<P>

You can also use a commercial debugger such as Affrus (Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X), Komodo
from Activestate (Windows and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X), or <FONT SIZE="-1">EPIC</FONT> (most platforms).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I profile my Perl programs?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26 <FONT SIZE="-1">PDT</FONT> 2008)
<P>

The <TT>&quot;Devel&quot;</TT> namespace has several modules which you can use to
profile your Perl programs. The <TT>&quot;Devel::DProf&quot;</TT> module comes with Perl
and you can invoke it with the <TT>&quot;-d&quot;</TT> switch:
<P>



<PRE>
        perl -d:DProf program.pl

</PRE>


<P>

After running your program under <TT>&quot;DProf&quot;</TT>, you'll get a <I>tmon.out</I> file
with the profile data. To look at the data, you can turn it into a
human-readable report with the <TT>&quot;dprofpp&quot;</TT> program that comes with
<TT>&quot;Devel::DProf&quot;</TT>.
<P>



<PRE>
        dprofpp

</PRE>


<P>

You can also do the profiling and reporting in one step with the <TT>&quot;-p&quot;</TT>
switch to &lt;dprofpp&gt;:
<P>



<PRE>
        dprofpp -p program.pl

</PRE>


<P>

The <TT>&quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;</TT> (New York Times Profiler) does both statement
and subroutine profiling. It's available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and you also invoke
it with the <TT>&quot;-d&quot;</TT> switch:
<P>



<PRE>
        perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl

</PRE>


<P>

Like <TT>&quot;DProf&quot;</TT>, it creates a database of the profile information that you
can turn into reports. The <TT>&quot;nytprofhtml&quot;</TT> command turns the data into
an <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT> report similar to the <TT>&quot;Devel::Cover&quot;</TT> report:
<P>



<PRE>
        nytprofhtml

</PRE>


<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> has several other profilers that you can invoke in the same
fashion. You might also be interested in using the <TT>&quot;Benchmark&quot;</TT> to
measure and compare code snippets.
<P>

You can read more about profiling in <I>Programming Perl</I>, chapter 20,
or <I>Mastering Perl</I>, chapter 5.
<P>

perldebguts documents creating a custom debugger if you need to
create a special sort of profiler. brian d foy describes the process
in <I>The Perl Journal</I>, ``Creating a Perl Debugger'',
<A HREF="http://www.ddj.com/184404522">http://www.ddj.com/184404522</A> , and ``Profiling in Perl''
<A HREF="http://www.ddj.com/184404580">http://www.ddj.com/184404580</A> .
<P>

Perl.com has two interesting articles on profiling: ``Profiling Perl'',
by Simon Cozens, <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850">http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850</A> and ``Debugging and
Profiling mod_perl Applications'', by Frank Wiles,
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html</A> .
<P>

Randal L. Schwartz writes about profiling in ``Speeding up Your Perl
Programs'' for <I>Unix Review</I>,
<A HREF="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html</A> , and ``Profiling
in Template Toolkit via Overriding'' for <I>Linux Magazine</I>,

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference reports
for Perl programs.
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts
to make them easier to read by trying to follow the rules of the
perlstyle. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much time reading
them, you will probably find it useful.  It is available at
<A HREF="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net">http://perltidy.sourceforge.net</A>
<P>

Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle,
you shouldn't need to reformat.  The habit of formatting your code
as you write it will help prevent bugs.  Your editor can and should
help you with this.  The perl-mode or newer cperl-mode for emacs
can provide remarkable amounts of help with most (but not all)
code, and even less programmable editors can provide significant
assistance.  Tom Christiansen and many other <FONT SIZE="-1">VI</FONT> users  swear by
the following settings in vi and its clones:
<P>



<PRE>
    set ai sw=4
    map! ^O {^M}^[O^T

</PRE>


<P>

Put that in your <I>.exrc</I> file (replacing the caret characters
with control characters) and away you go.  In insert mode, ^T is
for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and ^O is for blockdenting---as
it were.  A more complete example, with comments, can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</A>
<P>

The a2ps <A HREF="http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz">http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz</A> does
lots of things related to generating nicely printed output of
documents.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Is there a ctags for Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

Ctags uses an index to quickly find things in source code, and many
popular editors support ctags for several different languages,
including Perl.
<P>

Exuberent ctags supports Perl: <A HREF="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</A>
<P>

You might also try pltags: <A HREF="http://www.mscha.com/pltags.zip">http://www.mscha.com/pltags.zip</A>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Is there an <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT> or Windows Perl Editor?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will do.
<P>

If you're on Unix, you already have an IDE---Unix itself.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT>
philosophy is the philosophy of several small tools that each do one
thing and do it well.  It's like a carpenter's toolbox.
<P>

Zeus for Window is another Win32 multi-language editor/IDE
that comes with support for Perl:
</DL>
<P>

For editors: if you're on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone
already, and possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to download
anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x cperl-mode) gives you
perhaps the best available Perl editing mode in any editor.
<P>

If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that lets you work
with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad.  Word processors, such as
Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, typically do not work since they insert
all sorts of behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to
save files as ``Text Only''. You can also download text editors designed
specifically for programming, such as Textpad (
<A HREF="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com/</A> ) and UltraEdit ( <A HREF="http://www.ultraedit.com/">http://www.ultraedit.com/</A> ),
among others.
<P>

If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply.  MacPerl (for Classic
environments) comes with a simple editor. Popular external editors are
BBEdit ( <A HREF="http://www.bbedit.com/">http://www.bbedit.com/</A> ) or Alpha (
<A HREF="http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html">http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html</A> ). MacOS X users can use

nvi ( <A HREF="http://www.bostic.com/vi/">http://www.bostic.com/vi/</A> , available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> in src/misc/) is
yet another vi clone, unfortunately not available for Windows, but in
<FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> platforms you might be interested in trying it out, firstly because
strictly speaking it is not a vi clone, it is the real vi, or the new
incarnation of it, and secondly because you can embed Perl inside it
to use Perl as the scripting language.  nvi is not alone in this,
though: at least also vim and vile offer an embedded Perl.

<H3>How can I write a <FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> (X, Tk, Gtk, etc.) in Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
<A NAME="ixABT"></A>
(contributed by Ben Morrow)
<P>

There are a number of modules which let you write GUIs in Perl. Most
<FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> toolkits have a perl interface: an incomplete list follows.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Tk<DD>
<A NAME="ixABU"></A>
This works under Unix and Windows, and the current version doesn't
look half as bad under Windows as it used to. Some of the gui elements
still don't 'feel' quite right, though. The interface is very natural
and 'perlish', making it easy to use in small scripts that just need a
simple gui. It hasn't been updated in a while.
<DT>Wx<DD>
<A NAME="ixABV"></A>
This is a Perl binding for the cross-platform wxWidgets toolkit
( <A HREF="http://www.wxwidgets.org">http://www.wxwidgets.org</A> ). It works under Unix, Win32 and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X,
using native widgets (Gtk under Unix). The interface follows the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
interface closely, but the documentation is a little sparse for someone
who doesn't know the library, mostly just referring you to the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
documentation.
<DT>Gtk and Gtk2<DD>
<A NAME="ixABW"></A>
These are Perl bindings for the Gtk toolkit ( <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</A> ). The
interface changed significantly between versions 1 and 2 so they have
separate Perl modules. It runs under Unix, Win32 and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X (currently
it requires an X server on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>, but a 'native' port is underway), and
the widgets look the same on every plaform: i.e., they don't match the
native widgets. As with Wx, the Perl bindings follow the C <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> closely,
and the documentation requires you to read the C documentation to
understand it.
<DT>Win32::GUI<DD>
<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
This provides access to most of the Win32 <FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> widgets from Perl.
Obviously, it only runs under Win32, and uses native widgets. The Perl
interface doesn't really follow the C interface: it's been made more
Perlish, and the documentation is pretty good. More advanced stuff may
require familiarity with the C Win32 APIs, or reference to <FONT SIZE="-1">MSDN</FONT>.
<DT>CamelBones<DD>
<A NAME="ixABY"></A>
CamelBones ( <A HREF="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net">http://camelbones.sourceforge.net</A> ) is a Perl interface to
Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X's Cocoa <FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> toolkit, and as such can be used to produce native
GUIs on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X. It's not on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, as it requires frameworks that
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm doesn't know how to install, but installation is via the
standard <FONT SIZE="-1">OSX</FONT> package installer. The Perl <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> is, again, very close to
the ObjC <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> it's wrapping, and the documentation just tells you how to
translate from one to the other.
<DT>Qt<DD>
<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
There is a Perl interface to TrollTech's Qt toolkit, but it does not
appear to be maintained.
<DT>Athena<DD>

again it appears not to be much used nowadays.

<H3>How can I make my Perl program run faster?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACB"></A>
The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm.  This
can often make a dramatic difference.  Jon Bentley's book
<I>Programming Pearls</I> (that's not a misspelling!)  has some good tips
on optimization, too.  Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark
and profile to make sure you're optimizing the right part, look for
better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and when all else
fails consider just buying faster hardware.  You will probably want to
read the answer to the earlier question ``How do I profile my Perl
programs?'' if you haven't done so already.
<P>

A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl code.  See the
AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for
that.  Or you could locate the bottleneck and think about writing just
that part in C, the way we used to take bottlenecks in C code and
write them in assembler.  Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have
critical sections can be written in C (for instance, the <FONT SIZE="-1">PDL</FONT> module
from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>).
<P>

If you're currently linking your perl executable to a shared
<I>libc.so</I>, you can often gain a 10-25% performance benefit by
rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a instead.  This will make a
bigger perl executable, but your Perl programs (and programmers) may
thank you for it.  See the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> file in the source distribution
for more information.
<P>

The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by
storing the already-compiled form to disk.  This is no longer a viable
option, as it only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good
solution anyway.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I make my Perl program take less memory?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACC"></A>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to
throw memory at a problem.  Scalars in Perl use more memory than
strings in C, arrays take more than that, and hashes use even more.  While
there's still a lot to be done, recent releases have been addressing
these issues.  For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are
shared amongst all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.
<P>

In some cases, using <I>substr()</I> or <I>vec()</I> to simulate arrays can be
highly beneficial.  For example, an array of a thousand booleans will
take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one
125-byte bit vector---a considerable memory savings.  The standard
Tie::SubstrHash module can also help for certain types of data
structure.  If you're working with specialist data structures
(matrices, for instance) modules that implement these in C may use
less memory than equivalent Perl modules.
<P>

Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with
the system malloc or with Perl's builtin malloc.  Whichever one it
is, try using the other one and see whether this makes a difference.
Information about malloc is in the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> file in the source
distribution.  You can find out whether you are using perl's malloc by
typing <TT>&quot;perl -V:usemymalloc&quot;</TT>.
<P>

Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do anything to waste
it in the first place. Good programming practices can go a long way
toward this:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Don't slurp!


<P>


Don't read an entire file into memory if you can process it line
by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        #
        # Good Idea
        #
        while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
           # ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


instead of this:


<P>




<PRE>
        #
        # Bad Idea
        #
        @data = &lt;FILE&gt;;
        foreach (@data) {
            # ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


When the files you're processing are small, it doesn't much matter which
way you do it, but it makes a huge difference when they start getting
larger.
<DT>*<DD>
Use map and grep selectively


<P>


Remember that both map and grep expect a <FONT SIZE="-1">LIST</FONT> argument, so doing this:


<P>




<PRE>
        @wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;FILE&gt;;

</PRE>




<P>


will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large files, it's better
to loop:


<P>




<PRE>
        while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
                push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
        }

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification


<P>


Don't quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:


<P>




<PRE>
        my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


makes 2 copies of <TT>$large_string</TT> (one for <TT>$copy</TT> and another for the
quotes), whereas


<P>




<PRE>
        my $copy = $large_string;

</PRE>




<P>


only makes one copy.


<P>


Ditto for stringifying large arrays:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
                local $, = &quot;\n&quot;;
                print @big_array;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


is much more memory-efficient than either


<P>




<PRE>
        print join &quot;\n&quot;, @big_array;

</PRE>




<P>


or


<P>




<PRE>
        {
                local $&quot; = &quot;\n&quot;;
                print &quot;@big_array&quot;;
        }

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Pass by reference


<P>


Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For one thing, it's
the only way to pass multiple lists or hashes (or both) in a single
call/return. It also avoids creating a copy of all the contents. This
requires some judgement, however, because any changes will be propagated
back to the original data. If you really want to mangle (er, modify) a
copy, you'll have to sacrifice the memory needed to make one.
<DT>*<DD>
Tie large variables to disk.


<P>


For ``big'' data stores (i.e. ones that exceed available memory) consider
using one of the <FONT SIZE="-1">DB</FONT> modules to store it on disk instead of in <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>. This
will incur a penalty in access time, but that's probably better than
causing your hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Is it safe to return a reference to local or lexical data?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACD"></A>
Yes. Perl's garbage collection system takes care of this so
everything works out right.
<P>



<PRE>
    sub makeone {
        my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
        return \@a;
    }

    for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        push @many, makeone();
    }

    print $many[4][5], &quot;\n&quot;;

    print &quot;@many\n&quot;;

</PRE>

<H3>How can I free an array or hash so my program shrinks?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACE"></A>
(contributed by Michael Carman)
<P>

You usually can't. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e. <I>my()</I> variables)
cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they go out of scope. It is
reserved in case the variables come back into scope. Memory allocated
to global variables can be reused (within your program) by using
<I>undef()</I> and/or <I>delete()</I>.
<P>

On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program can never be
returned to the system. That's why long-running programs sometimes re-
exec themselves. Some operating systems (notably, systems that use
<I><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+mmap">mmap</A></I>(2) for allocating large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that
is no longer used, but on such systems, perl must be configured and
compiled to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>'s malloc, not perl's.
<P>

In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can
or should be worrying about much in Perl.
<P>

See also ``How can I make my Perl program take less memory?''
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I make my <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> script more efficient?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACF"></A>
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs
faster or smaller, a <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> program has additional issues.  It may be run
several times per second.  Given that each time it runs it will need
to be re-compiled and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system
memory, this can be a killer.  Compiling into C <B>isn't going to help
you</B> because the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.
<P>

There are two popular ways to avoid this overhead.  One solution
involves running the Apache <FONT SIZE="-1">HTTP</FONT> server (available from
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A> ) with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi
plugin modules.
<P>

With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module (distributed with
mod_perl), httpd will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which
pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the same address
space without forking.  The Apache extension also gives Perl access to
the internal server <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>, so modules written in Perl can do just about
anything a module written in C can.  For more on mod_perl, see
<A HREF="http://perl.apache.org/">http://perl.apache.org/</A>
<P>

With the <FONT SIZE="-1">FCGI</FONT> module (from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>) and the mod_fastcgi
module (available from <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/">http://www.fastcgi.com/</A> ) each of your Perl
programs becomes a permanent <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> daemon process.
<P>

Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system
and on the way you write your <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> programs, so investigate them with
care.
<P>

See <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/</A> .
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I hide the source for my Perl program?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACG"></A>
Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of ``security''.
<P>

First of all, however, you <I>can't</I> take away read permission, because
the source code has to be readable in order to be compiled and
interpreted.  (That doesn't mean that a <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> script's source is
readable by people on the web, though---only by people with access to
the filesystem.)  So you have to leave the permissions at the socially
friendly 0755 level.
<P>

Some people regard this as a security problem.  If your program does
insecure things and relies on people not knowing how to exploit those
insecurities, it is not secure.  It is often possible for someone to
determine the insecure things and exploit them without viewing the
source.  Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs
instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.
<P>

You can try using encryption via source filters (Starting from Perl
5.8 the Filter::Simple and Filter::Util::Call modules are included in
the standard distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to
decrypt it.  You can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter
described later in perlfaq3, but the curious might still be able to
de-compile it. You can try using the native-code compiler described
later, but crackers might be able to disassemble it.  These pose
varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to get at your code,
but none can definitively conceal it (true of every language, not just
Perl).
<P>

It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs.  You simply
feed the program to the perl interpreter and use the modules in
the B:: hierarchy.  The B::Deparse module should be able to
defeat most attempts to hide source.  Again, this is not
unique to Perl.
<P>

If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will give you
legal security.  License your software and pepper it with threatening
statements like ``This is unpublished proprietary software of <FONT SIZE="-1">XYZ</FONT> Corp.
Your access to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.''  We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if
you want to be sure your license's wording will stand up in court.

<A NAME="ixACH"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

In general, you can't do this.  There are some things that may work
for your situation though.  People usually ask this question
because they want to distribute their works without giving away
the source code, and most solutions trade disk space for convenience.
You probably won't see much of a speed increase either, since most
solutions simply bundle a Perl interpreter in the final product
(but see ``How can I make my Perl program run faster?'').

<H3>Why don't Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?</H3>

The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems

which the one-liners were created.  On some systems, you may have to
change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NOT</I></FONT><I></I> do on Unix
or Plan9 systems.  You might also have to change a single % to a %%.
<P>

For example:
<P>

    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

    # DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;

    # Mac Classic
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)

    # MPW

    # VMS

The problem is that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the

it's entirely possible that neither works.  If 4DOS was the command shell,

quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Mac's non-ASCII
characters as control characters.
<P>

Using <I>qq()</I>, q(), and <I>qx()</I>, instead of ``double quotes'', 'single
quotes', and `backticks`, may make one-liners easier to write.
<P>

There is no general solution to all of this.  It is a mess.

<H3>Where can I learn about <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> or Web programming in Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACL"></A>
For modules, get the <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT> modules from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.  For textbooks,
see the two especially dedicated to web stuff in the question on
books.  For problems and questions related to the web, like ``Why
do I get 500 Errors'' or ``Why doesn't it run from the browser right
when it runs fine on the command line'', see the troubleshooting
guides and references in perlfaq9 or in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> MetaFAQ:

<H3>Where can I learn about object-oriented Perl programming?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
A good place to start is perltoot, and you can use perlobj,
perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and perlbot for reference.
<P>

A good book on <FONT SIZE="-1">OO</FONT> on Perl is the ``Object-Oriented Perl''
by Damian Conway from Manning Publications, or ``Intermediate Perl''
by Randal Schwartz, brian d foy, and Tom Phoenix from O'Reilly Media.
<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Where can I learn about linking C with Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut,
moving on to perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts.  If you want to
call Perl from C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and
perlguts.  Don't forget that you can learn a lot from looking at
how the authors of existing extension modules wrote their code and
solved their problems.
<P>

You might not need all the power of <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT>. The Inline::C module lets
you put C code directly in your Perl source. It handles all the
magic to make it work. You still have to learn at least some of
the perl <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> but you won't have to deal with the complexity of the
<FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> support files.
<A NAME="lbBE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>I've read perlembed, perlguts, etc., but I can't embed perl in my C program; what am I doing wrong?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACO"></A>
Download the ExtUtils::Embed kit from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and run `make test'.  If
the tests pass, read the pods again and again and again.  If they
fail, see perlbug and send a bug report with the output of
<TT>&quot;make test TEST_VERBOSE=1&quot;</TT> along with <TT>&quot;perl -V&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>When I tried to run my script, I got this message. What does it mean?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACP"></A>
A complete list of Perl's error messages and warnings with explanatory
text can be found in perldiag. You can also use the splain program
(distributed with Perl) to explain the error messages:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl program 2&gt;diag.out
    splain [-v] [-p] diag.out

</PRE>


<P>

or change your program to explain the messages for you:
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics;

</PRE>


<P>

or
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics -verbose;

</PRE>

<H3>What's MakeMaker?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACQ"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The <TT>&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</TT> module, better known simply as ``MakeMaker'',
turns a Perl script, typically called <TT>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</TT>, into a Makefile.
The unix tool <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> uses this file to manage dependencies and actions
to process and install a Perl distribution.
