pidstat - Report statistics for Linux tasks.

<B>] ]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>pidstat</B>

command is used for monitoring individual tasks currently being managed
by the Linux kernel.
It writes to standard output activities for every task selected with option
<B>-p</B>

or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if option
<B>-p ALL</B>

has been used. Not selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying
<B>-p ALL</B>

but only active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values)
will appear in the report.
<P>
The
<B>pidstat</B>

command can also be used for monitoring the child processes of selected tasks.
Read about option
<B>-T</B>

below.
<P>
The
<I>interval</I>

parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report.
A value of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that tasks statistics are
to be reported for the time since system startup (boot).
The
<I>count</I>

parameter can be specified in conjunction with the
<I>interval</I>

parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of
<I>count</I>

determines the number of reports generated at
<I>interval</I>

seconds apart. If the
<I>interval</I>

parameter is specified without the
<I>count</I>

parameter, the
<B>pidstat</B>

command generates reports continuously.
<P>
You can select information about specific task activities using flags.
Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

together with its children.
</DL>

</DL>

<DT>-t<DD>

<DT>-T { TASK | CHILD | ALL }<DD>
This option specifies what has to be monitored by the
