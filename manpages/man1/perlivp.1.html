<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The <B>perlivp</B> program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the
Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:
<P>



<PRE>
    make install

</PRE>


<P>

(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that <B>perl</B> and its
libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is verified
by output that looks like:
<P>



<PRE>
    ok 1
    ok 2

</PRE>


<P>

etc.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Perl binary `$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n'';


<P>


Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Perl version `$]' installed, expected <TT>$ivp_VERSION</TT>.\n'';


<P>


Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Perl \@INC directory `$_' does not appear to exist.\n'';


<P>


Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Needed module `$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n'';


<P>


One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the 
installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely affects perlivp's
ability to function.  You may be able to correct this by performing a
proper perl installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Required module `$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n'';


<P>


An attempt to <TT>&quot;eval &quot;require $module&quot;&quot;</TT> failed, even though the list of 
extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by conducting a proper 
installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Unnecessary module `bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n'';


<P>


This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed 
a bLuRfle.pm module or that the <TT>&quot;eval &quot; require \&quot;$module_name.pm\&quot;; &quot;&quot;</TT>
test may give misleading results with your installation of perl.  If yours
is the latter case then please let the author know.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# file'',+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's',`` missing from installation:\n'';


<P>


One or more files turned up missing according to a run of 
<TT>&quot;ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()&quot;</TT> over your installation.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.
<DT>*<DD>
print ``# Perl header `$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n'';


<P>


Correct by running <B>h2ph</B> over your system's C header files.  If necessary, 
edit the resulting *.ph files to eliminate perl syntax errors.
</DL>
<P>

For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the 
<FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL</FONT> file that comes with the perl source and the <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT> file for your 
platform.
