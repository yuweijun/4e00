passwd - update user's authentication tokens
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>passwd [-k] [-l] [-u [-f]] [-d] [-e] [-n mindays] [-x maxdays] [-w warndays] [-i inactivedays] [-S] [--stdin] [username]</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The passwd utility is used to update user's authentication token(s).
<P>
This task is achieved through calls to the
<B>Linux-PAM</B> and 

<B>Libuser API</B>. 

Essentially, it initializes itself as a &quot;passwd&quot; service with
<I>Linux-PAM</I>

and utilizes configured
<I>password</I>

modules to authenticate and then update a user's password.
<P>
<P>
A simple entry in the global
<I>Linux-PAM</I>

configuration file for this service would be:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;#
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;#&nbsp;passwd&nbsp;service&nbsp;entry&nbsp;that&nbsp;does&nbsp;strength&nbsp;checking&nbsp;of
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;#&nbsp;a&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;password&nbsp;before&nbsp;updating&nbsp;it.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-k</B><DD>
The option
<B>-k</B>, 

is used to indicate that the update should only be for expired
authentication tokens (passwords); the user wishes to keep their
non-expired tokens as before.
<P>
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
This option is used to lock the specified account and it is available
to root only. The locking is performed by rendering the encrypted
password into an invalid string (by prefixing the encrypted string
with an !).
<P>
<DT><B>--stdin</B><DD>
This option is used to indicate that <B>passwd</B> should read the new
password from standard input, which can be a pipe.
<P>
<DT><B>-u</B><DD>
This is the reverse of the
<B>-l</B> option - it will unlock the account

password by removing the ! prefix. This option is available to root
only. By default passwd will refuse to create a passwordless account 
(it will not unlock an account that has only &quot;!&quot; as a password). The 
force option <B>-f</B> will override this protection.
<P>
<DT><B>-d</B><DD>
This is a quick way to delete a password for an account. It will set
the named account passwordless. Available to root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-e</B><DD>
This is a quick way to expire a password for an account. The user will be
forced to change the password during the next login attempt.
Available to root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
This will set the minimum password lifetime, in days, if the user's
account supports password lifetimes.  Available to root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-x</B><DD>
This will set the maximum password lifetime, in days, if the user's
account supports password lifetimes.  Available to root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
This will set the number of days in advance the user will begin receiving
warnings that her password will expire, if the user's account supports
password lifetimes.  Available to root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
This will set the number of days which will pass before an expired password
for this account will be taken to mean that the account is inactive and should
be disabled, if the user's account supports password lifetimes.  Available to
root only.
<P>
<DT><B>-S</B><DD>
This will output a short information about the status of the password
for a given account. Available to root user only.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Remember the following two principles</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Protect&nbsp;your&nbsp;password.</B><DD>
Don't write down your password - memorize it.
In particular, don't write it down and leave it anywhere, and don't
place it in an unencrypted file!  Use unrelated passwords for
systems controlled by different organizations.  Don't give or share your
password, in particular to someone claiming to be from
computer support or a vendor.  Don't let anyone watch you enter your
password.  Don't enter your password to a computer you don't trust or
if things Use the password for a limited time and change it periodically.
<P>
<DT><B>Choose&nbsp;a&nbsp;hard-to-guess&nbsp;password.</B><DD>
<I>passwd</I>

through the calls to the
<B>pam_cracklib</B> PAM module

will try to prevent you from choosing a really bad password,
but it isn't foolproof; create your password wisely.
Don't use something you'd find in a dictionary (in any language or jargon).
Don't use a name (including that of a spouse, parent, child, pet,
fantasy character, famous person, and location) or any
variation of your personal or account name.  Don't use accessible
information about you (such as your phone number, license plate, or
social security number) or your environment.  Don't use a birthday or a
simple pattern (such as backwards, followed by a digit, or preceded by a digit. Instead, use
a mixture of upper and lower case letters, as well as digits or
punctuation.  When choosing a new password, make sure it's unrelated
to any previous password. Use long passwords (say at least 8 characters
long).  You might use a word pair with punctuation inserted, a
passphrase (an understandable sequence of words), or the first
letter of each word in a passphrase.
<P>

These principles are partially enforced by the system, but only partly so.
Vigilence on your part will make the system much more secure.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT CODE</H2>

<P>
On successful completion of its task,
<B>passwd</B>

will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of 1 indicates an error
occurred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.
