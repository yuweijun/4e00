<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Eject</B>

allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or JAZ
or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control. The command can
also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature
supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM
drives.
<P>
The device corresponding to &lt;name&gt; is ejected. The name can be a
device file or mount point, either a full path or with the leading
&quot;/dev&quot;, &quot;/media&quot; or &quot;/mnt&quot; omitted. If no name is specified, the default name
&quot;cdrom&quot; is used.
<P>
There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on whether the
device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable floppy, or tape. By default
eject tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.
<P>
If the device is currently mounted, it is unmounted before ejecting.

<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
This option causes
<B>eject</B>

to display a brief description of the command options.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
This makes
<B>eject</B>

run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the
command is doing.
<P>
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
If invoked with this option,
<B>eject</B>

lists the default device name.
<P>
<DT><B>-a on|1|off|0</B>

<DD>
This option controls the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices.
When enabled, the drive automatically ejects when the device is
closed.
<P>
<DT><B>-c &lt;slot&gt;</B>

<DD>
With this option a CD slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD-ROM
changer. Linux 2.0 or higher is required to use this feature. The
CD-ROM drive can not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD)
for a change request to work. Please also note that the first slot of
the changer is referred to as 0, not 1.
<P>
<DT><B>-i on|1|off|0</B>

<DD>
This option controls locking of the hardware eject button. When
enabled, the drive will not be ejected when the button is pressed.
This is useful when you are carrying a laptop in a bag or case and
don't want it to eject if the button is inadvertently pressed.
<P>
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command. Not
all devices support this command.
<P>
<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command if
it's opened, and a CD-ROM tray eject command if it's closed. Not all
devices support this command, because it uses the above CD-ROM tray
close command.
<P>
<DT><B>-x &lt;speed&gt;</B>

<DD>
With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM select speed command.
The speed argument is a number indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8
for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate. Not all devices support
this command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable
of. Every time the media is changed this option is cleared. This
option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c options.
<P>
<DT><B>-X </B>

<DD>
With this option the CD-ROM drive will be probed to detect the
available speeds. The output is a list of speeds which can be used as
an argument of the -x option. This only works with Linux 2.6.13 or
higher, on previous versions solely the maximum speed will be
reported. Also note that some drive may not correctly report the speed
and therefore this option does not work with them.
<P>
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
With this option the selected device is displayed but no action is
performed.
<P>
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a
CDROM eject command.
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using
SCSI commands.
<P>
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a
removable floppy disk eject command.
<P>
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a
tape drive offline command.
<P>
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
This option allow you to use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. It
also passes the -n option to <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+umount">umount</A>(1).
<P>
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
This option allows eject to work with device drivers which automatically
mount removable media and therefore must be always <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+mount">mount</A>(1)ed.
The option tells eject to not try to unmount the given device,
even if it is mounted according to /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.
<P>
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
This option causes
<B>eject</B>

to display the program version and exit.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

<P>
<B>Eject</B>

only works with devices that support one or more of the four methods
of ejecting. This includes most CD-ROM drives (IDE, SCSI, and
proprietary), some SCSI tape drives, JAZ drives, ZIP drives (parallel
port, SCSI, and IDE versions), and LS120 removable floppies. Users
have also reported success with floppy drives on Sun SPARC and Apple
Macintosh systems. If
<B>eject</B>

does not work, it is most likely a limitation of the kernel driver
for the device and not the
<B>eject</B>

program itself.
<P>
The -r, -s, -f, and -q options allow controlling which methods are
used to eject. More than one method can be specified. If none of these
options are specified, it tries all four (this works fine in most
cases).
<P>
<B>Eject</B>

may not always be able to determine if the device is mounted (e.g. if
it has several names). If the device name is a symbolic link,
<B>eject</B>

will follow the link and use the device that it points to.
<P>
If
<B>eject</B>

determines that the device can have multiple partitions, it will
attempt to unmount all mounted partitions of the device before
ejecting. If an unmount fails, the program will not attempt to eject
the media.
<P>
You can eject an audio CD. Some CD-ROM drives will refuse to open the
tray if the drive is empty. Some devices do not support the tray close
command.
<P>
If the auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive will always be
ejected after running this command. Not all Linux kernel CD-ROM
drivers support the auto-eject mode. There is no way to find out the
state of the auto-eject mode.
<P>
You need appropriate privileges to access the device files. Running as
root or setuid root is required to eject some devices (e.g. SCSI
devices).
<P>
The heuristic used to find a device, given a name, is as follows. If
the name ends in a trailing slash, it is removed (this is to support
filenames generated using shell file name completion). If the name
starts with '.' or '/', it tries to open it as a device file or mount
point. If that fails, it tries prepending '/dev/', '/media/' ,'/mnt/',
'/dev/cdroms', '/dev/rdsk/', '/dev/dsk/', and finally './' to the name,
until a
device file or mount point is found that can be opened. The program
checks /etc/mtab for mounted devices. If that fails, it also checks
/etc/fstab for mount points of currently unmounted devices.
<P>
Creating symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom or /dev/zip is recommended
so that
<B>eject</B>

can determine the appropriate devices using easily remembered names.
<P>
To save typing you can create a shell alias for the eject options that
work for your particular setup.
