<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

perl587delta - what is new for perl v5.8.7
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.6 release and
the 5.8.7 release.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Incompatible Changes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.6.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Core Enhancements</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Unicode Character Database 4.1.0</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has
been updated to 4.1.0 from 4.0.1. See
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/#NotableChanges</A>&gt; for the
notable changes.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>suidperl less insecure</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
A pair of exploits in <TT>&quot;suidperl&quot;</TT> involving debugging code have been closed.
<P>

For new projects the core perl team strongly recommends that you use
dedicated, single purpose security tools such as <TT>&quot;sudo&quot;</TT> in preference to
<TT>&quot;suidperl&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Optional site customization script</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
The perl interpreter can be built to allow the use of a site customization
script. By default this is not enabled, to be consistent with previous perl
releases. To use this, add <TT>&quot;-Dusesitecustomize&quot;</TT> to the command line flags
when running the <TT>&quot;Configure&quot;</TT> script. See also ``-f'' in perlrun.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Config.pm is now much smaller.</H3>



<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
<TT>&quot;Config.pm&quot;</TT> is now about 3K rather than 32K, with the infrequently used
code and <TT>%Config</TT> values loaded on demand. This is transparent to the
programmer, but means that most code will save parsing and loading 29K of
script (for example, code that uses <TT>&quot;File::Find&quot;</TT>).

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Utility Changes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>find2perl enhancements</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
<TT>&quot;find2perl&quot;</TT> has new options <TT>&quot;-iname&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;-path&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;-ipath&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Performance Enhancements</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
The internal pointer mapping hash used during ithreads cloning now uses an
arena for memory allocation. In tests this reduced ithreads cloning time by
about 10%.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Installation and Configuration Improvements</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The Win32 ``dmake'' makefile.mk has been updated to make it compatible
with the latest versions of dmake.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;PERL_MALLOC&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;DEBUG_MSTATS&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED_EXPLICIT&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;NO_HASH_SEED&quot;</TT>
should now work in Win32 makefiles.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Selected Bug Fixes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>socket()</I> function on Win32 has been fixed so that it is able to use
transport providers which specify a protocol of 0 (meaning any protocol
is allowed) once more.  (This was broken in 5.8.6, and typically caused
the use of <FONT SIZE="-1">ICMP</FONT> sockets to fail.)
<DT>*<DD>
Another obscure bug involving <TT>&quot;substr&quot;</TT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> caused by bad internal
offset caching has been identified and fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
A bug involving the loading of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> tables by the regexp engine has been
fixed - code such as <TT>&quot;&quot;\x{100}&quot; =~ /[[:print:]]/&quot;</TT> will no longer give
corrupt results.
<DT>*<DD>
Case conversion operations such as <TT>&quot;uc&quot;</TT> on a long Unicode string could
exhaust memory. This has been fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;index&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;rindex&quot;</TT> were buggy for some combinations of Unicode and
non-Unicode data. This has been fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;read&quot;</TT> (and presumably <TT>&quot;sysread&quot;</TT>) would expose the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> internals when
reading from a byte oriented file handle into a <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> scalar. This has
been fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
Several <TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;unpack&quot;</TT> bug fixes:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Checksums with <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> formats were broken.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;unpack&quot;</TT> checksums could overflow with the <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> format.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;U0&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;C0&quot;</TT> are now scoped to <TT>&quot;()&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT> sub-templates.
<DT>*<DD>
Counted length prefixes now don't change <TT>&quot;C0&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;U0&quot;</TT> mode.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;Z0&quot;</TT> used to destroy the preceding character.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;P&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;p&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT> formats used to only recognise literal <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT>
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</DL>

<DT>*<DD>
Using closures with ithreads could cause perl to crash. This was due to
failure to correctly lock internal <FONT SIZE="-1">OP</FONT> structures, and has been fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
The return value of <TT>&quot;close&quot;</TT> now correctly reflects any file errors that
occur while flushing the handle's data, instead of just giving failure if
the actual underlying file close operation failed.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;not() || 1&quot;</TT> used to segfault. <TT>&quot;not()&quot;</TT> now behaves like <TT>not(0)</TT>, which was
the pre 5.6.0 behaviour.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;h2ph&quot;</TT> has various enhancements to cope with constructs in header files that
used to result in incorrect or invalid output.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>New or Changed Diagnostics</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
There is a new taint error, ``%ENV is aliased to <TT>%s</TT>''. This error is thrown
when taint checks are enabled and when <TT>*ENV</TT> has been aliased, so that
<TT>%ENV</TT> has no env-magic anymore and hence the environment cannot be verified
as taint-free.
<P>

The internals of <TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;unpack&quot;</TT> have been updated. All legitimate
templates should work as before, but there may be some changes in the error
reported for complex failure cases. Any behaviour changes for non-error cases
are bugs, and should be reported.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Changed Internals</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
There has been a fair amount of refactoring of the <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> source code, partly to
make it tidier and more maintainable. The resulting object code and the
<TT>&quot;perl&quot;</TT> binary may well be smaller than 5.8.6, and hopefully faster in some
cases, but apart from this there should be no user-detectable changes.
<P>

<TT>&quot;${^UTF8LOCALE}&quot;</TT> has been added to give perl space access to <TT>&quot;PL_utf8locale&quot;</TT>.
<P>

The size of the arenas used to allocate <FONT SIZE="-1">SV</FONT> heads and most <FONT SIZE="-1">SV</FONT> bodies can now
be changed at compile time. The old size was 1008 bytes, the new default size
is 4080 bytes.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Known Problems</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
Unicode strings returned from overloaded operators can be buggy. This is a
long standing bug reported since 5.8.6 was released, but we do not yet have
a suitable fix for it.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Platform Specific Problems</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
On <FONT SIZE="-1">UNICOS</FONT>, lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc.t hangs burning <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>.
ext/B/t/bytecode.t and ext/Socket/t/socketpair.t both fail tests.
These are unlikely to be resolved, as our valiant <FONT SIZE="-1">UNICOS</FONT> porter's last
Cray is being decommissioned.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Reporting Bugs</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at <A HREF="http://bugs.perl.org.">http://bugs.perl.org.</A>  There may also be
information at <A HREF="http://www.perl.org,">http://www.perl.org,</A> the Perl Home Page.
<P>

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <B>perlbug</B>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of <TT>&quot;perl -V&quot;</TT>, will be sent off to <A HREF="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</A> to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search
