<H2>NAME</H2>

perlfaq7 - General Perl Language Issues
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This section deals with general Perl language issues that don't
clearly fit into any of the other sections.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Can I get a BNF/yacc/RE for the Perl language?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
There is no <FONT SIZE="-1">BNF</FONT>, but you can paw your way through the yacc grammar in
perly.y in the source distribution if you're particularly brave.  The
grammar relies on very smart tokenizing code, so be prepared to
venture into toke.c as well.
<P>

In the words of Chaim Frenkel: ``Perl's grammar can not be reduced to <FONT SIZE="-1">BNF</FONT>.
The work of parsing perl is distributed between yacc, the lexer, smoke
and mirrors.''
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What are all these $@%&amp;* punctuation signs, and how do I know when to use them?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
They are type specifiers, as detailed in perldata:
<P>



<PRE>
        $ for scalar values (number, string or reference)
        @ for arrays
        % for hashes (associative arrays)
        &amp; for subroutines (aka functions, procedures, methods)
        * for all types of that symbol name.  In version 4 you used them like
          pointers, but in modern perls you can just use references.

</PRE>


<P>

There are couple of other symbols that you're likely to encounter that aren't
really type specifiers:
<P>



<PRE>
        &lt;&gt; are used for inputting a record from a filehandle.
        \  takes a reference to something.

</PRE>


<P>

Note that &lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">FILE</FONT>&gt; is <I>neither</I> the type specifier for files
nor the name of the handle.  It is the <TT>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</TT> operator applied
to the handle <FONT SIZE="-1">FILE</FONT>.  It reads one line (well, record---see
``$/'' in perlvar) from the handle <FONT SIZE="-1">FILE</FONT> in scalar context, or <I>all</I> lines
in list context.  When performing open, close, or any other operation
besides <TT>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</TT> on files, or even when talking about the handle, do
<I>not</I> use the brackets.  These are correct: <TT>&quot;eof(FH)&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;seek(FH, 0,
2)&quot;</TT> and ``copying from <FONT SIZE="-1">STDIN</FONT> to <FONT SIZE="-1">FILE</FONT>''.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Do I always/never have to quote my strings or use semicolons and commas?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
Normally, a bareword doesn't need to be quoted, but in most cases
probably should be (and must be under <TT>&quot;use strict&quot;</TT>).  But a hash key
consisting of a simple word (that isn't the name of a defined
subroutine) and the left-hand operand to the <TT>&quot;=&gt;&quot;</TT> operator both
count as though they were quoted:
<P>



<PRE>
        This                    is like this
        ------------            ---------------
        $foo{line}              $foo{'line'}
        bar =&gt; stuff            'bar' =&gt; stuff

</PRE>


<P>

The final semicolon in a block is optional, as is the final comma in a
list.  Good style (see perlstyle) says to put them in except for
one-liners:
<P>



<PRE>
        if ($whoops) { exit 1 }
        @nums = (1, 2, 3);

        if ($whoops) {
                exit 1;
        }

        @lines = (
        &quot;There Beren came from mountains cold&quot;,
        &quot;And lost he wandered under leaves&quot;,
        );

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I skip some return values?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
One way is to treat the return values as a list and index into it:
<P>



<PRE>
        $dir = (getpwnam($user))[7];

</PRE>


<P>

Another way is to use undef as an element on the left-hand-side:
<P>



<PRE>
        ($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);

</PRE>


<P>

You can also use a list slice to select only the elements that
you need:
<P>



<PRE>
        ($dev, $ino, $uid, $gid) = ( stat($file) )[0,1,4,5];

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I temporarily block warnings?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
If you are running Perl 5.6.0 or better, the <TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT> pragma
allows fine control of what warning are produced.
See perllexwarn for more details.
<P>



<PRE>
        {
        no warnings;          # temporarily turn off warnings
        $a = $b + $c;         # I know these might be undef
        }

</PRE>


<P>

Additionally, you can enable and disable categories of warnings.
You turn off the categories you want to ignore and you can still
get other categories of warnings.  See perllexwarn for the
complete details, including the category names and hierarchy.
<P>



<PRE>
        {
        no warnings 'uninitialized';
        $a = $b + $c;
        }

</PRE>


<P>

If you have an older version of Perl, the <TT>$^W</TT> variable (documented
in perlvar) controls runtime warnings for a block:
<P>



<PRE>
        {
        local $^W = 0;        # temporarily turn off warnings
        $a = $b + $c;         # I know these might be undef
        }

</PRE>


<P>

Note that like all the punctuation variables, you cannot currently
use <I>my()</I> on <TT>$^W</TT>, only <I>local()</I>.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What's an extension?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
An extension is a way of calling compiled C code from Perl.  Reading
perlxstut is a good place to learn more about extensions.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why do Perl operators have different precedence than C operators?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Actually, they don't.  All C operators that Perl copies have the same
precedence in Perl as they do in C.  The problem is with operators that C
doesn't have, especially functions that give a list context to everything
on their right, eg. print, chmod, exec, and so on.  Such functions are
called ``list operators'' and appear as such in the precedence table in
perlop.
<P>

A common mistake is to write:
<P>



<PRE>
        unlink $file || die &quot;snafu&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

This gets interpreted as:
<P>



<PRE>
        unlink ($file || die &quot;snafu&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses or use the
super low precedence <TT>&quot;or&quot;</TT> operator:
<P>



<PRE>
        (unlink $file) || die &quot;snafu&quot;;
        unlink $file or die &quot;snafu&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

The ``English'' operators (<TT>&quot;and&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;or&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;xor&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;not&quot;</TT>)
deliberately have precedence lower than that of list operators for
just such situations as the one above.
<P>

Another operator with surprising precedence is exponentiation.  It
binds more tightly even than unary minus, making <TT>&quot;-2**2&quot;</TT> produce a
negative not a positive four.  It is also right-associating, meaning
that <TT>&quot;2**3**2&quot;</TT> is two raised to the ninth power, not eight squared.
<P>

Although it has the same precedence as in C, Perl's <TT>&quot;?:&quot;</TT> operator
produces an lvalue.  This assigns <TT>$x</TT> to either <TT>$a</TT> or <TT>$b</TT>, depending
on the trueness of <TT>$maybe:</TT>
<P>



<PRE>
        ($maybe ? $a : $b) = $x;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I declare/create a structure?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
In general, you don't ``declare'' a structure.  Just use a (probably
anonymous) hash reference.  See perlref and perldsc for details.
Here's an example:
<P>



<PRE>
        $person = {};                   # new anonymous hash
        $person-&gt;{AGE}  = 24;           # set field AGE to 24
        $person-&gt;{NAME} = &quot;Nat&quot;;        # set field NAME to &quot;Nat&quot;

</PRE>


<P>

If you're looking for something a bit more rigorous, try perltoot.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I create a module?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

perlmod, perlmodlib, perlmodstyle explain modules
in all the gory details. perlnewmod gives a brief
overview of the process along with a couple of suggestions
about style.
<P>

If you need to include C code or C library interfaces in
your module, you'll need h2xs.  h2xs will create the module
distribution structure and the initial interface files
you'll need.  perlxs and perlxstut explain the details.
<P>

If you don't need to use C code, other tools such as
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and Module::Starter, can help you
create a skeleton module distribution.
<P>

You may also want to see Sam Tregar's ``Writing Perl Modules
for <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>'' ( <A HREF="http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=14">http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=14</A> )
which is the best hands-on guide to creating module
distributions.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I adopt or take over a module already on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The full answer to this can be found at
<A HREF="http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover">http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover</A>
<P>

The easiest way to take over a module is to have the current
module maintainer either make you a co-maintainer or transfer
the module to you.
<P>

If you can't reach the author for some reason (e.g. email bounces),
the <FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT> admins at <A HREF="mailto:modules@perl.org">modules@perl.org</A> can help. The <FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT> admins
treat each case individually.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Get a login for the Perl Authors Upload Server (<FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT>) if you don't
already have one: <A HREF="http://pause.perl.org">http://pause.perl.org</A>
<DT>*<DD>
Write to <A HREF="mailto:modules@perl.org">modules@perl.org</A> explaining what you did to contact the
current maintainer. The <FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT> admins will also try to reach the
maintainer.
<DT>*<DD>
Post a public message in a heavily trafficked site announcing your
intention to take over the module.
<DT>*<DD>
Wait a bit. The <FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT> admins don't want to act too quickly in case
the current maintainer is on holiday. If there's no response to
private communication or the public post, a <FONT SIZE="-1">PAUSE</FONT> admin can transfer
it to you.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I create a class?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

In Perl, a class is just a package, and methods are just subroutines.
Perl doesn't get more formal than that and lets you set up the package
just the way that you like it (that is, it doesn't set up anything for
you).
<P>

The Perl documentation has several tutorials that cover class
creation, including perlboot (Barnyard Object Oriented Tutorial),
perltoot (Tom's Object Oriented Tutorial), perlbot (Bag o'
Object Tricks), and perlobj.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I tell if a variable is tainted?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
You can use the <I>tainted()</I> function of the Scalar::Util module, available
from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> (or included with Perl since release 5.8.0).
See also ``Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data'' in perlsec.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What's a closure?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
Closures are documented in perlref.
<P>

<I>Closure</I> is a computer science term with a precise but
hard-to-explain meaning. Usually, closures are implemented in Perl as
anonymous subroutines with lasting references to lexical variables
outside their own scopes. These lexicals magically refer to the
variables that were around when the subroutine was defined (deep
binding).
<P>

Closures are most often used in programming languages where you can
have the return value of a function be itself a function, as you can
in Perl. Note that some languages provide anonymous functions but are
not capable of providing proper closures: the Python language, for
example.  For more information on closures, check out any textbook on
functional programming.  Scheme is a language that not only supports
but encourages closures.
<P>

Here's a classic non-closure function-generating function:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub add_function_generator {
                return sub { shift() + shift() };
                }

        $add_sub = add_function_generator();
        $sum = $add_sub-&gt;(4,5);                # $sum is 9 now.

</PRE>


<P>

The anonymous subroutine returned by <I>add_function_generator()</I> isn't
technically a closure because it refers to no lexicals outside its own
scope.  Using a closure gives you a <I>function template</I> with some
customization slots left out to be filled later.
<P>

Contrast this with the following <I>make_adder()</I> function, in which the
returned anonymous function contains a reference to a lexical variable
outside the scope of that function itself.  Such a reference requires
that Perl return a proper closure, thus locking in for all time the
value that the lexical had when the function was created.
<P>



<PRE>
        sub make_adder {
                my $addpiece = shift;
                return sub { shift() + $addpiece };
        }

        $f1 = make_adder(20);
        $f2 = make_adder(555);

</PRE>


<P>

Now <TT>&quot;&amp;$f1($n)&quot;</TT> is always 20 plus whatever <TT>$n</TT> you pass in, whereas
<TT>&quot;&amp;$f2($n)&quot;</TT> is always 555 plus whatever <TT>$n</TT> you pass in.  The <TT>$addpiece</TT>
in the closure sticks around.
<P>

Closures are often used for less esoteric purposes.  For example, when
you want to pass in a bit of code into a function:
<P>



<PRE>
        my $line;
        timeout( 30, sub { $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; } );

</PRE>


<P>

If the code to execute had been passed in as a string,
<TT>'$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;'</TT>, there would have been no way for the
hypothetical <I>timeout()</I> function to access the lexical variable
<TT>$line</TT> back in its caller's scope.
<P>

Another use for a closure is to make a variable <I>private</I> to a
named subroutine, e.g. a counter that gets initialized at creation
time of the sub and can only be modified from within the sub.
This is sometimes used with a <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT> block in package files to make
sure a variable doesn't get meddled with during the lifetime of the
package:
<P>



<PRE>
        BEGIN {
                my $id = 0;
                sub next_id { ++$id }
        }

</PRE>


<P>

This is discussed in more detail in perlsub, see the entry on
<I>Persistent Private Variables</I>.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What is variable suicide and how can I prevent it?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
This problem was fixed in perl 5.004_05, so preventing it means upgrading
your version of perl. ;)
<P>

Variable suicide is when you (temporarily or permanently) lose the value
of a variable.  It is caused by scoping through <I>my()</I> and <I>local()</I>
interacting with either closures or aliased <I>foreach()</I> iterator variables
and subroutine arguments.  It used to be easy to inadvertently lose a
variable's value this way, but now it's much harder.  Take this code:
<P>



<PRE>
        my $f = 'foo';
        sub T {
                while ($i++ &lt; 3) { my $f = $f; $f .= &quot;bar&quot;; print $f, &quot;\n&quot; }
                }

        T;
        print &quot;Finally $f\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

If you are experiencing variable suicide, that <TT>&quot;my $f&quot;</TT> in the subroutine
doesn't pick up a fresh copy of the <TT>$f</TT> whose value is &lt;foo&gt;. The output
shows that inside the subroutine the value of <TT>$f</TT> leaks through when it
shouldn't, as in this output:
<P>



<PRE>
        foobar
        foobarbar
        foobarbarbar
        Finally foo

</PRE>


<P>

The <TT>$f</TT> that has ``bar'' added to it three times should be a new <TT>$f</TT>
<TT>&quot;my $f&quot;</TT> should create a new lexical variable each time through the loop.
The expected output is:
<P>



<PRE>
        foobar
        foobar
        foobar
        Finally foo

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I pass/return a {Function, FileHandle, Array, Hash, Method, Regex}?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
With the exception of regexes, you need to pass references to these
objects.  See ``Pass by Reference'' in perlsub for this particular
question, and perlref for information on references.
<P>

See ``Passing Regexes'', later in perlfaq7, for information on
passing regular expressions.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Passing Variables and Functions<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
Regular variables and functions are quite easy to pass: just pass in a
reference to an existing or anonymous variable or function:


<P>




<PRE>
        func( \$some_scalar );

        func( \@some_array  );
        func( [ 1 .. 10 ]   );

        func( \%some_hash   );
        func( { this =&gt; 10, that =&gt; 20 }   );

        func( \&amp;some_func   );
        func( sub { $_[0] ** $_[1] }   );

</PRE>


<DT>Passing Filehandles<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
As of Perl 5.6, you can represent filehandles with scalar variables
which you treat as any other scalar.


<P>




<PRE>
        open my $fh, $filename or die &quot;Cannot open $filename! $!&quot;;
        func( $fh );

        sub func {
                my $passed_fh = shift;

                my $line = &lt;$passed_fh&gt;;
                }

</PRE>




<P>


Before Perl 5.6, you had to use the <TT>*FH</TT> or <TT>&quot;\*FH&quot;</TT> notations.
These are ``typeglobs''--see ``Typeglobs and Filehandles'' in perldata
and especially ``Pass by Reference'' in perlsub for more information.
<DT>Passing Regexes<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
To pass regexes around, you'll need to be using a release of Perl
sufficiently recent as to support the <TT>&quot;qr//&quot;</TT> construct, pass around
strings and use an exception-trapping eval, or else be very, very clever.


<P>


Here's an example of how to pass in a string to be regex compared
using <TT>&quot;qr//&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
        sub compare($$) {
                my ($val1, $regex) = @_;
                my $retval = $val1 =~ /$regex/;
        return $retval;
        }
        $match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, qr/d.*D/i);

</PRE>




<P>


Notice how <TT>&quot;qr//&quot;</TT> allows flags at the end.  That pattern was compiled
at compile time, although it was executed later.  The nifty <TT>&quot;qr//&quot;</TT>
notation wasn't introduced until the 5.005 release.  Before that, you
had to approach this problem much less intuitively.  For example, here
it is again if you don't have <TT>&quot;qr//&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
        sub compare($$) {
                my ($val1, $regex) = @_;
                my $retval = eval { $val1 =~ /$regex/ };
        die if $@;
        return $retval;
        }

        $match = compare(&quot;old McDonald&quot;, q/($?i)d.*D/);

</PRE>




<P>


Make sure you never say something like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        return eval &quot;\$val =~ /$regex/&quot;;   # WRONG

</PRE>




<P>


or someone can sneak shell escapes into the regex due to the double
interpolation of the eval and the double-quoted string.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        $pattern_of_evil = 'danger ${ system(&quot;rm -rf * &amp;&quot;) } danger';

        eval &quot;\$string =~ /$pattern_of_evil/&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


Those preferring to be very, very clever might see the O'Reilly book,
<I>Mastering Regular Expressions</I>, by Jeffrey Friedl.  Page 273's
<I>Build_MatchMany_Function()</I> is particularly interesting.  A complete
citation of this book is given in perlfaq2.
<DT>Passing Methods<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
To pass an object method into a subroutine, you can do this:


<P>




<PRE>
        call_a_lot(10, $some_obj, &quot;methname&quot;)
        sub call_a_lot {
                my ($count, $widget, $trick) = @_;
                for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++) {
                        $widget-&gt;$trick();
                }
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Or, you can use a closure to bundle up the object, its
method call, and arguments:


<P>




<PRE>
        my $whatnot =  sub { $some_obj-&gt;obfuscate(@args) };
        func($whatnot);
        sub func {
                my $code = shift;
                &amp;$code();
        }

</PRE>




<P>


You could also investigate the <I>can()</I> method in the <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIVERSAL</FONT> class
(part of the standard perl distribution).

<H3>How do I create a static variable?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

In Perl 5.10, declare the variable with <TT>&quot;state&quot;</TT>. The <TT>&quot;state&quot;</TT>
declaration creates the lexical variable that persists between calls
to the subroutine:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub counter { state $count = 1; $counter++ }

<P>

You can fake a static variable by using a lexical variable which goes
out of scope. In this example, you define the subroutine <TT>&quot;counter&quot;</TT>, and
it uses the lexical variable <TT>$count</TT>. Since you wrap this in a <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT>
block, <TT>$count</TT> is defined at compile-time, but also goes out of
scope at the end of the <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT> block. The <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT> block also ensures that
the subroutine and the value it uses is defined at compile-time so the
subroutine is ready to use just like any other subroutine, and you can
put this code in the same place as other subroutines in the program
text (i.e. at the end of the code, typically). The subroutine
<TT>&quot;counter&quot;</TT> still has a reference to the data, and is the only way you
can access the value (and each time you do, you increment the value).
The data in chunk of memory defined by <TT>$count</TT> is private to
<TT>&quot;counter&quot;</TT>.
<P>



<PRE>
        BEGIN {
                my $count = 1;
                sub counter { $count++ }
        }

        my $start = counter();

        .... # code that calls counter();

        my $end = counter();

</PRE>


<P>

In the previous example, you created a function-private variable
because only one function remembered its reference. You could define
multiple functions while the variable is in scope, and each function
can share the ``private'' variable. It's not really ``static'' because you
can access it outside the function while the lexical variable is in
scope, and even create references to it. In this example,
<TT>&quot;increment_count&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;return_count&quot;</TT> share the variable. One
function adds to the value and the other simply returns the value.
They can both access <TT>$count</TT>, and since it has gone out of scope,
there is no other way to access it.
<P>



<PRE>
        BEGIN {
                my $count = 1;
                sub increment_count { $count++ }
                sub return_count    { $count }
        }

</PRE>


<P>

To declare a file-private variable, you still use a lexical variable.
A file is also a scope, so a lexical variable defined in the file
cannot be seen from any other file.
<P>

See ``Persistent Private Variables'' in perlsub for more information.
The discussion of closures in perlref may help you even though we
did not use anonymous subroutines in this answer. See
``Persistent Private Variables'' in perlsub for details.

<H3>What's the difference between dynamic and lexical (static) scoping?  Between <I>local()</I> and <I>my()</I>?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
<TT>&quot;local($x)&quot;</TT> saves away the old value of the global variable <TT>$x</TT>
and assigns a new value for the duration of the subroutine <I>which is
visible in other functions called from that subroutine</I>.  This is done
at run-time, so is called dynamic scoping.  <I>local()</I> always affects global
variables, also called package variables or dynamic variables.
<P>

<TT>&quot;my($x)&quot;</TT> creates a new variable that is only visible in the current
subroutine.  This is done at compile-time, so it is called lexical or
static scoping.  <I>my()</I> always affects private variables, also called
lexical variables or (improperly) static(ly scoped) variables.
<P>

For instance:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub visible {
                print &quot;var has value $var\n&quot;;
                }

        sub dynamic {
                local $var = 'local';   # new temporary value for the still-global
                visible();              #   variable called $var
                }

        sub lexical {
                my $var = 'private';    # new private variable, $var
                visible();              # (invisible outside of sub scope)
                }

        $var = 'global';

        visible();                      # prints global
        dynamic();                      # prints local
        lexical();                      # prints global

</PRE>


<P>

Notice how at no point does the value ``private'' get printed.  That's
because <TT>$var</TT> only has that value within the block of the <I>lexical()</I>
function, and it is hidden from called subroutine.
<P>

In summary, <I>local()</I> doesn't make what you think of as private, local
variables.  It gives a global variable a temporary value.  <I>my()</I> is
what you're looking for if you want private variables.
<P>

See ``Private Variables via <I>my()</I>'' in perlsub and
``Temporary Values via <I>local()</I>'' in perlsub for excruciating details.

<H3>How can I access a dynamic variable while a similarly named lexical is in scope?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
If you know your package, you can just mention it explicitly, as in
<TT>$Some_Pack::var</TT>. Note that the notation <TT>$::var</TT> is <B>not</B> the dynamic <TT>$var</TT>
in the current package, but rather the one in the ``main'' package, as
though you had written <TT>$main::var</TT>.
<P>



<PRE>
        use vars '$var';
        local $var = &quot;global&quot;;
        my    $var = &quot;lexical&quot;;

        print &quot;lexical is $var\n&quot;;
        print &quot;global  is $main::var\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

Alternatively you can use the compiler directive <I>our()</I> to bring a
dynamic variable into the current lexical scope.
<P>



<PRE>
        require 5.006; # our() did not exist before 5.6
        use vars '$var';

        local $var = &quot;global&quot;;
        my $var    = &quot;lexical&quot;;

        print &quot;lexical is $var\n&quot;;

        {
                our $var;

<H3>What's the difference between deep and shallow binding?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
In deep binding, lexical variables mentioned in anonymous subroutines
are the same ones that were in scope when the subroutine was created.
In shallow binding, they are whichever variables with the same names
happen to be in scope when the subroutine is called.  Perl always uses
deep binding of lexical variables (i.e., those created with <I>my()</I>).
However, dynamic variables (aka global, local, or package variables)
are effectively shallowly bound.  Consider this just one more reason
not to use them.  See the answer to ``What's a closure?''.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why doesn't my($foo) = &lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">FILE</FONT>&gt;; work right?</H3>



<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
<TT>&quot;my()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;local()&quot;</TT> give list context to the right hand side
of <TT>&quot;=&quot;</TT>.  The &lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">FH</FONT>&gt; read operation, like so many of Perl's
functions and operators, can tell which context it was called in and
behaves appropriately.  In general, the <I>scalar()</I> function can help.
This function does nothing to the data itself (contrary to popular myth)
but rather tells its argument to behave in whatever its scalar fashion is.
If that function doesn't have a defined scalar behavior, this of course
doesn't help you (such as with <I>sort()</I>).
<P>

To enforce scalar context in this particular case, however, you need
merely omit the parentheses:
<P>



<PRE>
        local($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;;       # WRONG
        local($foo) = scalar(&lt;FILE&gt;);   # ok
        local $foo  = &lt;FILE&gt;;       # right

</PRE>


<P>

You should probably be using lexical variables anyway, although the
issue is the same here:
<P>



<PRE>
        my($foo) = &lt;FILE&gt;;      # WRONG
        my $foo  = &lt;FILE&gt;;      # right

<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I redefine a builtin function, operator, or method?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
Why do you want to do that? :-)
<P>

If you want to override a predefined function, such as <I>open()</I>,
then you'll have to import the new definition from a different
module.  See ``Overriding Built-in Functions'' in perlsub.  There's
also an example in ``Class::Template'' in perltoot.
<P>

If you want to overload a Perl operator, such as <TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;**&quot;</TT>,
then you'll want to use the <TT>&quot;use overload&quot;</TT> pragma, documented
in overload.
<P>

If you're talking about obscuring method calls in parent classes,
see ``Overridden Methods'' in perltoot.

<H3>What's the difference between calling a function as &amp;foo and <I>foo()</I>?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

Calling a subroutine as <TT>&amp;foo</TT> with no trailing parentheses ignores
the prototype of <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> and passes it the current value of the argumet
list, <TT>@_</TT>. Here's an example; the <TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT> subroutine calls <TT>&amp;foo</TT>,
which prints what its arguments list:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub bar { &amp;foo }

        sub foo { print &quot;Args in foo are: @_\n&quot; }

        bar( qw( a b c ) );

</PRE>


<P>

When you call <TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT> with arguments, you see that <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> got the same <TT>@_</TT>:
<P>



<PRE>
        Args in foo are: a b c

</PRE>


<P>

Calling the subroutine with trailing parentheses, with or without arguments,
does not use the current <TT>@_</TT> and respects the subroutine prototype. Changing
the example to put parentheses after the call to <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> changes the program:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub bar { &amp;foo() }

        sub foo { print &quot;Args in foo are: @_\n&quot; }

        bar( qw( a b c ) );

</PRE>


<P>

Now the output shows that <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> doesn't get the <TT>@_</TT> from its caller.
<P>



<PRE>
        Args in foo are:

</PRE>


<P>

The main use of the <TT>@_</TT> pass-through feature is to write subroutines
whose main job it is to call other subroutines for you. For further
details, see perlsub.

<H3>How do I create a switch or case statement?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
In Perl 5.10, use the <TT>&quot;given-when&quot;</TT> construct described in perlsyn:
<P>



<PRE>
        use 5.010;

        given ( $string ) {
                when( 'Fred' )        { say &quot;I found Fred!&quot; }
                when( 'Barney' )      { say &quot;I found Barney!&quot; }
                when( /Bamm-?Bamm/ )  { say &quot;I found Bamm-Bamm!&quot; }
                default               { say &quot;I don't recognize the name!&quot; }
                };

</PRE>


<P>

If one wants to use pure Perl and to be compatible with Perl versions
prior to 5.10, the general answer is to use <TT>&quot;if-elsif-else&quot;</TT>:
<P>



<PRE>
        for ($variable_to_test) {
                if    (/pat1/)  { }     # do something
                elsif (/pat2/)  { }     # do something else
                elsif (/pat3/)  { }     # do something else
                else            { }     # default
                }

</PRE>


<P>

Here's a simple example of a switch based on pattern matching,
lined up in a way to make it look more like a switch statement.
We'll do a multiway conditional based on the type of reference stored

<P>



<PRE>
    SWITCH: for (ref $whatchamacallit) {

        /SCALAR/        &amp;&amp; do {
                                print_scalar($$ref);
                                last SWITCH;
                        };

                                print_array(@$ref);
                                last SWITCH;
                        };

        /HASH/          &amp;&amp; do {
                                print_hash(%$ref);
                                last SWITCH;
                        };

        /CODE/          &amp;&amp; do {
                                warn &quot;can't print function ref&quot;;
                                last SWITCH;
                        };

Sometimes you should change the positions of the constant and the variable.
For example, let's say you wanted to test which of many answers you were
given, but in a case-insensitive way that also allows abbreviations.
You can use the following technique if the strings all start with
different characters or if you want to arrange the matches so that
one takes precedence over another, as <TT>&quot;SEND&quot;</TT> has precedence over
<TT>&quot;STOP&quot;</TT> here:
<P>



<PRE>
        chomp($answer = &lt;&gt;);
        if    (&quot;SEND&quot;  =~ /^\Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is send\n&quot;  }
        elsif (&quot;STOP&quot;  =~ /^\Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is stop\n&quot;  }
        elsif (&quot;ABORT&quot; =~ /^\Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is abort\n&quot; }
        elsif (&quot;LIST&quot;  =~ /^\Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is list\n&quot;  }
        elsif (&quot;EDIT&quot;  =~ /^\Q$answer/i) { print &quot;Action is edit\n&quot;  }

</PRE>


<P>

A totally different approach is to create a hash of function references.
<P>



<PRE>
        my %commands = (
                &quot;happy&quot; =&gt; \&amp;joy,
                &quot;sad&quot;,  =&gt; \&amp;sullen,
                &quot;done&quot;  =&gt; sub { die &quot;See ya!&quot; },
                &quot;mad&quot;   =&gt; \&amp;angry,
        );

        print &quot;How are you? &quot;;
        chomp($string = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
        if ($commands{$string}) {
                $commands{$string}-&gt;();
        } else {
                print &quot;No such command: $string\n&quot;;
        }

</PRE>


<P>

Starting from Perl 5.8, a source filter module, <TT>&quot;Switch&quot;</TT>, can also be
used to get switch and case. Its use is now discouraged, because it's
not fully compatible with the native switch of Perl 5.10, and because,
as it's implemented as a source filter, it doesn't always work as intended
when complex syntax is involved.

<H3>How can I catch accesses to undefined variables, functions, or methods?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> method, discussed in ``Autoloading'' in perlsub and
``<FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD:</FONT> Proxy Methods'' in perltoot, lets you capture calls to
undefined functions and methods.
<P>

When it comes to undefined variables that would trigger a warning
under <TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT>, you can promote the warning to an error.
<P>



<PRE>
        use warnings FATAL =&gt; qw(uninitialized);

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why can't a method included in this same file be found?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
Some possible reasons: your inheritance is getting confused, you've
misspelled the method name, or the object is of the wrong type.  Check
out perltoot for details about any of the above cases.  You may
also use <TT>&quot;print ref($object)&quot;</TT> to find out the class <TT>$object</TT> was
blessed into.
<P>

Another possible reason for problems is because you've used the
indirect object syntax (eg, <TT>&quot;find Guru &quot;Samy&quot;&quot;</TT>) on a class name
before Perl has seen that such a package exists.  It's wisest to make
sure your packages are all defined before you start using them, which
will be taken care of if you use the <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> statement instead of
<TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT>.  If not, make sure to use arrow notation (eg.,
<TT>&quot;Guru-&gt;find(&quot;Samy&quot;)&quot;</TT>) instead.  Object notation is explained in
perlobj.
<P>

Make sure to read about creating modules in perlmod and
the perils of indirect objects in ``Method Invocation'' in perlobj.
<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I find out my current or calling package?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

To find the package you are currently in, use the special literal
<TT>&quot;__PACKAGE__&quot;</TT>, as documented in perldata. You can only use the
special literals as separate tokens, so you can't interpolate them
into strings like you can with variables:
<P>



<PRE>
        my $current_package = __PACKAGE__;
        print &quot;I am in package $current_package\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

This is different from finding out the package an object is blessed
into, which might not be the current package. For that, use <TT>&quot;blessed&quot;</TT>
from <TT>&quot;Scalar::Util&quot;</TT>, part of the Standard Library since Perl 5.8:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);
        my $object_package = blessed( $object );

</PRE>


<P>

Most of the time, you shouldn't care what package an object is blessed
into, however, as long as it claims to inherit from that class:
<P>



<PRE>
        my $is_right_class = eval { $object-&gt;isa( $package ) }; # true or false

</PRE>


<P>

If you want to find the package calling your code, perhaps to give better
diagnostics as <TT>&quot;Carp&quot;</TT> does, use the <TT>&quot;caller&quot;</TT> built-in:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub foo {
                my @args = ...;
                my( $package, $filename, $line ) = caller;

                print &quot;I was called from package $package\n&quot;;
                );

</PRE>


<P>

By default, your program starts in package <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>, so you should
always be in some package unless someone uses the <TT>&quot;package&quot;</TT> built-in
with no namespace. See the <TT>&quot;package&quot;</TT> entry in perlfunc for the
details of empty packges.

<H3>How can I comment out a large block of Perl code?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The quick-and-dirty way to comment out more than one line of Perl is
to surround those lines with Pod directives. You have to put these
directives at the beginning of the line and somewhere where Perl
expects a new statement (so not in the middle of statements like the #
comments). You end the comment with <TT>&quot;=cut&quot;</TT>, ending the Pod section:
<P>



<PRE>
        =pod

        my $object = NotGonnaHappen-&gt;new();

        ignored_sub();

        $wont_be_assigned = 37;

        =cut

</PRE>


<P>

The quick-and-dirty method only works well when you don't plan to 
leave the commented code in the source. If a Pod parser comes along,
you're multiline comment is going to show up in the Pod translation.
A better way hides it from Pod parsers as well.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;=begin&quot;</TT> directive can mark a section for a particular purpose.
If the Pod parser doesn't want to handle it, it just ignores it. Label
the comments with <TT>&quot;comment&quot;</TT>. End the comment using <TT>&quot;=end&quot;</TT> with the
same label. You still need the <TT>&quot;=cut&quot;</TT> to go back to Perl code from
the Pod comment:
<P>



<PRE>
        =begin comment

        my $object = NotGonnaHappen-&gt;new();

        ignored_sub();

        $wont_be_assigned = 37;

        =end comment

        =cut

        ++$$varname;         # $fred now 24

</PRE>


<P>

This works <I>sometimes</I>, but it is a very bad idea for two reasons.
<P>

The first reason is that this technique <I>only works on global
variables</I>.  That means that if <TT>$fred</TT> is a lexical variable created
with <I>my()</I> in the above example, the code wouldn't work at all: you'd
accidentally access the global and skip right over the private lexical
altogether.  Global variables are bad because they can easily collide
accidentally and in general make for non-scalable and confusing code.
<P>

Symbolic references are forbidden under the <TT>&quot;use strict&quot;</TT> pragma.
They are not true references and consequently are not reference counted
or garbage collected.
<P>

The other reason why using a variable to hold the name of another
variable is a bad idea is that the question often stems from a lack of
understanding of Perl data structures, particularly hashes.  By using
symbolic references, you are just using the package's symbol-table hash
(like <TT>%main::</TT>) instead of a user-defined hash.  The solution is to
use your own hash or a real reference instead.
<P>



<PRE>
        $USER_VARS{&quot;fred&quot;} = 23;
        $varname = &quot;fred&quot;;
        $USER_VARS{$varname}++;  # not $$varname++

</PRE>


<P>

There we're using the <TT>%USER_VARS</TT> hash instead of symbolic references.
Sometimes this comes up in reading strings from the user with variable
references and wanting to expand them to the values of your perl
program's variables.  This is also a bad idea because it conflates the
program-addressable namespace and the user-addressable one.  Instead of
reading a string and expanding it to the actual contents of your program's
own variables:
<P>



<PRE>
        $str = 'this has a $fred and $barney in it';
        $str =~ s/(\$\w+)/$1/eeg;                 # need double eval

</PRE>


<P>

it would be better to keep a hash around like <TT>%USER_VARS</TT> and have
variable references actually refer to entries in that hash:
<P>



<PRE>
        $str =~ s/\$(\w+)/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all

</PRE>


<P>

That's faster, cleaner, and safer than the previous approach.  Of course,
you don't need to use a dollar sign.  You could use your own scheme to
make it less confusing, like bracketed percent symbols, etc.
<P>



<PRE>
        $str = 'this has a %fred% and %barney% in it';
        $str =~ s/%(\w+)%/$USER_VARS{$1}/g;   # no /e here at all

</PRE>


<P>

Another reason that folks sometimes think they want a variable to
contain the name of a variable is because they don't know how to build
proper data structures using hashes.  For example, let's say they
wanted two hashes in their program: <TT>%fred</TT> and <TT>%barney</TT>, and that they
wanted to use another scalar variable to refer to those by name.
<P>



<PRE>
        $name = &quot;fred&quot;;
        $$name{WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;     # set %fred

        $name = &quot;barney&quot;;
        $$name{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;; # set %barney

</PRE>


<P>

This is still a symbolic reference, and is still saddled with the
problems enumerated above.  It would be far better to write:
<P>



<PRE>
        $folks{&quot;fred&quot;}{WIFE}   = &quot;wilma&quot;;
        $folks{&quot;barney&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

And just use a multilevel hash to start with.
<P>

The only times that you absolutely <I>must</I> use symbolic references are
when you really must refer to the symbol table.  This may be because it's
something that can't take a real reference to, such as a format name.
Doing so may also be important for method calls, since these always go
through the symbol table for resolution.
<P>

In those cases, you would turn off <TT>&quot;strict 'refs'&quot;</TT> temporarily so you
can play around with the symbol table.  For example:
<P>



<PRE>
        @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
        for my $name (@colors) {
                no strict 'refs';  # renege for the block
                *$name = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
        }

</PRE>


<P>

All those functions (<I>red()</I>, <I>blue()</I>, <I>green()</I>, etc.) appear to be separate,
but the real code in the closure actually was compiled only once.
<P>

So, sometimes you might want to use symbolic references to directly
manipulate the symbol table.  This doesn't matter for formats, handles, and
subroutines, because they are always global---you can't use <I>my()</I> on them.
For scalars, arrays, and hashes, though---and usually for subroutines---
you probably only want to use hard references.

<H3>What does bad interpreter mean?</H3>



<A NAME="ixABL"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The ``bad interpreter'' message comes from the shell, not perl.  The
actual message may vary depending on your platform, shell, and locale
settings.
<P>

If you see ``bad interpreter - no such file or directory'', the first
line in your perl script (the ``shebang'' line) does not contain the
right path to perl (or any other program capable of running scripts).
Sometimes this happens when you move the script from one machine to
another and each machine has a different path to perl--/usr/bin/perl
versus /usr/local/bin/perl for instance. It may also indicate
that the source machine has <FONT SIZE="-1">CRLF</FONT> line terminators and the
destination machine has <FONT SIZE="-1">LF</FONT> only: the shell tries to find
/usr/bin/perl&lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">CR</FONT>&gt;, but can't.
<P>

If you see ``bad interpreter: Permission denied'', you need to make your
script executable.
<P>

In either case, you should still be able to run the scripts with perl
explicitly:
<P>



<PRE>
        % perl script.pl

</PRE>


<P>

If you get a message like ``perl: command not found'', perl is not in
your <FONT SIZE="-1">PATH</FONT>, which might also mean that the location of perl is not
where you expect it so you need to adjust your shebang line.
