<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>sar</B>

command writes to standard output the contents of selected
cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting
system, based on the values in the
<I>count</I>

and
<I>interval</I>

parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced
at the specified intervals in seconds.
If the
<I>interval</I>

parameter is set to zero, the
<B>sar</B>

command displays the average statistics for the time
since the system was started. If the
<I>interval</I>

parameter is specified without the
<I>count</I>

parameter, then reports are generated continuously.
The collected data can also
be saved in the file specified by the
<B>-o</B>

<I>filename</I>

flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If
<I>filename</I>

is omitted, sar uses the standard system activity daily data file,
the
<I>/var/log/sa/sa</I>dd

file, where the dd parameter indicates the current day.
By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the
data file.
<P>
The
<B>sar</B>

command extracts and writes to standard output records previously
saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the
<B>-f</B>

flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file.
<P>
Without the
<B>-P</B>

flag, the
<B>sar</B>

command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics,
which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages,
and as sums otherwise. If the
<B>-P</B>

flag is given, the
<B>sar</B>

command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or
processors. If
<B>-P ALL</B>

is given, the
<B>sar</B>

command reports statistics for each individual processor and global
statistics among all processors.
<P>
You can select information about specific system activities using
flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
Specifying the
<B>-A</B>

flag is equivalent to specifying
<B>-bBdqrRSvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.</B>

<P>
The default version of the
<B>sar</B>

command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities
the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it
monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent
(user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.
<P>
If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient
to specify an output file for the
<B>sar</B>

command. 
Run the
<B>sar</B>

command as a background process. The syntax for this is:
<P>
<B>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</B>

<P>
All data is captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile).
The data can then be selectively displayed with the
<B>sar</B>

command using the
<B>-f</B>

option. Set the
<I>interval</I>

and
<I>count</I>

parameters to select
<I>count</I>

records at
<I>interval</I>

second intervals. If the
<I>count</I>

parameter is not set, all the records saved in the
file will be selected.
Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize
system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.
<P>
Note:<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>The<BR>
<B>sar</B>

command only reports on local activities.

This is equivalent to specifying
<B>-bBdqrRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.</B>

<DT>-b<DD>
Report I/O and transfer rate statistics.
The following values are displayed:
<P>
<B>tps</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices.
A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical
requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device.
A transfer is of indeterminate size.
</DL>

<P>
<B>rtps</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total number of read requests per second issued to physical devices.
</DL>

<P>
<B>wtps</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total number of write requests per second issued to physical devices.
</DL>

<P>
<B>bread/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per second.
Blocks are equivalent to sectors with 2.4 kernels and newer
and therefore have a size of 512 bytes. With older kernels, a block is of
indeterminate size.
</DL>

<P>
<B>bwrtn/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per second.
</DL>

</DL>

<DT>-B<DD>
Report paging statistics. Some of the metrics below are available
only with post 2.5 kernels. The following values are displayed:
<P>
<B>pgpgin/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second.
Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per
second (and not kilobytes).
</DL>

<P>
<B>pgpgout/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.
Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per
second (and not kilobytes).
</DL>

<P>
<B>fault/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second.
This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page
faults can be resolved without I/O.
</DL>

<P>
<B>majflt/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which
have required loading a memory page from disk.
</DL>

<P>
<B>pgfree/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second.
</DL>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second.
</DL>

<P>
<B>pgscand/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of pages scanned directly per second.
</DL>

<P>
<B>pgsteal/s</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and
swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.
</DL>

<P>
<B>%vmeff</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of
page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the
tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less
than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty.
This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the
interval of time.
</DL>

</DL>

<DT>-C<DD>
When reading data from a file, tell
<B>sar</B>

to display comments that have been inserted by
<B>sadc</B>.

<DT>-d<DD>
Report activity for each block device (kernels 2.4 and newer only).
When data is displayed, the device specification
<I>dev m-n</I>

is generally used (
<B>DEV</B>

column).
<B>m</B>

is the major number of the device.
With recent kernels (post 2.5),
<B>n</B>

is the minor number of the device, but is only a sequence number with
pre 2.5 kernels. Device names may also be pretty-printed if option -p
is used (see below). Values for fields avgqu-sz, await, svctm and %util
may be unavailable and displayed as 0.00 with some 2.4 kernels.
Note that disk activity depends on sadc options &quot;-S DISK&quot; and &quot;-S XDISK&quot;
to be collected. The following values are displayed:
<P>
<B>tps</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device.

to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and
the time spent servicing them.
</DL>

<P>
<B>svctm</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued
to the device.
</DL>

<P>
<B>%util</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to the device
(bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this
value is close to 100%.
</DL>

</DL>

<DT>-e [ hh:mm:ss ]<DD>
Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is
18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.
This option can be used when data are read from
or written to a file (options
<B>-f</B>

or
<B>-o</B>

).
<DT>-f [ filename ]<DD>
Extract records from
<I>filename</I>

(created by the
<B>-o filename</B>

This is memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in
but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it doesn't need
to be swapped out again because it is already in the swap area. This
saves I/O).

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

The
<B>sar</B>

command takes into account the following environment variables:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>S_TIME_FORMAT<DD>
If this variable exists and its value is
<B>ISO</B>

then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header.
The
<B>sar</B>

command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
<P>
<DT>S_TIME_DEF_TIME<DD>
If this variable exists and its value is
<B>UTC</B>

then
<B>sar</B>

will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time).
<B>sar</B>

will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily
data file located in the
<I>/var/log/sa</I>

directory. This variable may be useful for servers with users located across
several timezones.
