<H2>NAME</H2>

udev - dynamic device management
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

udev provides a dynamic device directory containing only the files for actually present devices. It creates or removes device node files in the
/dev
directory, or it renames network interfaces.
<P>

Usually udev runs as
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+udevd">udevd</A></B>(8)
and receives uevents directly from the kernel if a device is added or removed from the system.
<P>

If udev receives a device event, it matches its configured rules against the available device attributes provided in sysfs to identify the device. Rules that match may provide additional device information or specify a device node name and multiple symlink names and instruct udev to run additional programs as part of the device event handling.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

<P>

udev configuration files are placed in
/etc/udev/
and
/lib/udev/. All empty lines, or lines beginning with '#' will be ignored.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Configuration file</H3>

<P>

udev expects its main configuration file at
/etc/udev/udev.conf. It consists of a set of variables allowing the user to override default udev values. The following variables can be set:
<P>

<B>udev_root</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Specifies where to place the device nodes in the filesystem. The default value is
/dev.
</DL>

<P>

<B>udev_log</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The logging priority. Valid values are the numerical syslog priorities or their textual representations:
<B>err</B>,
<B>info</B>
and
<B>debug</B>.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Rules files</H3>

<P>

The udev rules are read from the files located in the default rules directory
/lib/udev/rules.d/, the custom rules directory
/etc/udev/rules.d/
and the temporary rules directory
/dev/.udev/rules.d/. All rule files are sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless in which of these directories they live.
<P>

Rule files are required to have a unique name, duplicate file names are ignored. Files in
/etc/udev/rules.d/
have precedence over files with the same name in
/lib/udev/rules.d/. This can be used to ignore a default rules file if needed.
<P>

Every line in the rules file contains at least one key value pair. There are two kind of keys, match and assignment keys. If all match keys are matching against its value, the rule gets applied and the assign keys get the specified value assigned.
<P>

A matching rule may specify the name of the device node, add a symlink pointing to the node, or run a specified program as part of the event handling. If no matching rule is found, the default device node name is used.
<P>

A rule consists of a list of one or more key value pairs separated by a comma. Each key has a distinct operation, depending on the used operator. Valid operators are:
<P>

<B>==</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Compare for equality.
</DL>

<P>

<B>!=</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Compare for inequality.
</DL>

<P>

<B>=</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Assign a value to a key. Keys that represent a list, are reset and only this single value is assigned.
</DL>

<P>

<B>+=</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Add the value to a key that holds a list of entries.
</DL>

<P>

<B>:=</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Assign a value to a key finally; disallow any later changes, which may be used to prevent changes by any later rules.
</DL>

<P>

The following key names can be used to match against device properties. Some of the keys also match against properties of the parent devices in sysfs, not only the device that has generated the event. If multiple keys that match a parent device are specified in a single rule, all these keys must match at one and the same parent device.
<P>

<B>ACTION</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the name of the event action.
</DL>

<P>

<B>DEVPATH</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the name of the event device.
</DL>

<P>

<B>NAME</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the name of the node or network interface. It can be used once the NAME key has been set in one of the preceding rules.
</DL>

<P>

<B>SYMLINK</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the name of a symlink targeting the node. It can be used once a SYMLINK key has been set in one of the preceding rules. There may be multiple symlinks; only one needs to match.
</DL>

<P>

<B>SUBSYSTEM</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the subsystem of the event device.
</DL>

<P>

<B>DRIVER</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>

<B>ATTR{</B><B></B><I>filename</I><B>}</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

matches are specified, all of them must match on the same device. Trailing whitespace in the attribute values is ignored, if the specified match value does not contain trailing whitespace itself.
</DL>

<P>

<B>ENV{</B><B></B><I>key</I><B>}</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>

<B>PROGRAM</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Execute a program. The key is true, if the program returns successfully. The device properties are made available to the executed program in the environment. The program's output printed to stdout, is available in the RESULT key.
</DL>

<P>

<B>RESULT</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Match the returned string of the last PROGRAM call. This key can be used in the same or in any later rule after a PROGRAM call.
</DL>

<P>

Most of the fields support a shell style pattern matching. The following pattern characters are supported:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Matches zero, or any number of characters.
</DL>

<P>

<B>?</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Matches any single character.
</DL>

<P>

<B>[]</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Matches any single character specified within the brackets. For example, the pattern string 'tty[SR]' would match either 'ttyS' or 'ttyR'. Ranges are also supported within this match with the '-' character. For example, to match on the range of all digits, the pattern [0-9] would be used. If the first character following the '[' is a '!', any characters not enclosed are matched.
</DL>

<P>

The following keys can get values assigned:
<P>

<B>NAME</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The name of the node to be created, or the name the network interface should be renamed to.
</DL>

<P>

<B>SYMLINK</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>

<B>OWNER, GROUP, MODE</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The permissions for the device node. Every specified value overwrites the compiled-in default value.
</DL>

<P>

<B>ATTR{</B><B></B><I>key</I><B>}</B>

</DL>

<P>

<B>ENV{</B><B></B><I>key</I><B>}</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Set a device property value. Property names with a leading '.' are not stored in the database or exported to external tool or events.
</DL>

<P>

<B>RUN</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Add a program to the list of programs to be executed for a specific device. This can only be used for very short running tasks. Running an event process for a long period of time may block all further events for this or a dependent device. Long running tasks need to be immediately detached from the event process itself. If the option
<B>RUN{</B><B></B><I>fail_event_on_error</I><B>}</B>
is specified, and the executed program returns non-zero, the event will be marked as failed for a possible later handling.
<P>
If the specified string starts with
<B>socket:</B><B></B><I>path</I>, all current event values will be passed to the specified socket, as a message in the same format the kernel sends an uevent. If the first character of the specified path is an @ character, an abstract namespace socket is used, instead of an existing socket file.
</DL>

<P>

<B>LABEL</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Named label where a GOTO can jump to.
</DL>

<P>

<B>GOTO</B>

Import a text file specified as the assigned value, which must be in environment key format.
</DL>

<P>

<B>db</B>

</DL>

<P>

<B>cmdline</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import a single property from the kernel commandline. For simple flags the value of the property will be set to '1'.
</DL>

<P>

<B>parent</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import the stored keys from the parent device by reading the database entry of the parent device. The value assigned to
<B>IMPORT{parent}</B>
is used as a filter of key names to import (with the same shell-style pattern matching used for comparisons).
</DL>

<P>
If no option is given, udev will choose between
<B>program</B>
and
<B>file</B>
based on the executable bit of the file permissions.
</DL>

</DL>

<P>

<B>watch</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Watch the device node with inotify, when closed after being opened for writing, a change uevent will be synthesised.
