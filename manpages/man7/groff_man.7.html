<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>man</B>

macros used to generate man pages with
<I>groff</I>

were written by James Clark.
This document provides a brief summary of the use of each macro in that
package.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The
<B>man</B>

macros understand the following command line options (which define various
registers).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-rLL=</B><I>line-length</I>

<DD>
Set line length.
If this option is not given, the line length defaults to 78n in nroff mode
and 6.5i in troff mode.
<DT><B>-rLT=</B><I>title-length</I>

<DD>
Set title length.
If this option is not given, the title length defaults to 78n in nroff mode
and 6.5i in troff mode.
<DT><B>-rcR=1</B>

<DD>
This option (the default if in nroff mode) will create a single, very long
page instead of multiple pages.
Say
<B>-rcR=0</B>

to disable it.
<DT><B>-rC1</B>

<DD>
If more than one manual page is given on the command line, number the
pages continuously, rather than starting each at&nbsp;1.
<DT><B>-rD1</B>

<DD>
Double-sided printing.
Footers for even and odd pages are formatted differently.
<DT><B>-rP</B><I>nnn</I>

<DD>
Enumeration of pages will start with
<I>nnn</I>

rather than with&nbsp;1.
<DT><B>-rS</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
Base document font size is
<I>xx</I>

points
(<I>xx</I>

can be 10, 11, or&nbsp;12) rather than 10&nbsp;points.
<DT><B>-rX</B><I>nnn</I>

<DD>
After page&nbsp;<I>nnn</I>,

number pages as
<I>nnn</I>a,

<I>nnn</I>b,

<I>nnn</I>c,

etc.
For example, the option `-rX2' will produce the following page numbers:
1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USAGE</H2>

This section describes the available macros for manual pages.
For further customization, put additional macros and requests into the file
<B>man.local</B>

which will be loaded immediately after the
<B>man</B>

package.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.TH</B><I> title section </I><B>[</B><I>extra1</I><B>] [</B><I>extra2</I><B>] [</B><I>extra3</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets the title of the man page to
<I>title</I>

and the section to
<I>section</I>,

which must take on a value between 1 and&nbsp;8.
The value
<I>section</I>

may also have a string appended, e.g. `.pm', to indicate a specific
subsection of the man pages.
Both
<I>title</I>

and
<I>section</I>

are positioned at the left and right in the header line (with
<I>section</I>

in parentheses immediately appended to
<I>title</I>.

<I>extra1</I>

will be positioned in the middle of the footer line.
<I>extra2</I>

will be positioned at the left in the footer line (resp. at the left on
even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-sided printing is
active).
<I>extra3</I>

is centered in the header line.
<DT><DD>
For HTML output, headers and footers are completely supressed.
<DT><DD>
Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the new line number is&nbsp;1 again
(except if the `-rC1' option is given on the command line) -- this feature
is intended only for formatting multiple man pages; a single man page should
contain exactly one
<B>TH</B>

macro at the beginning of the file.
<DT><B>.SH [</B><I>text for a heading</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets up an unnumbered section heading sticking out to the left.
Prints out all the text following
<B>SH</B>

up to the end of the line (resp. the text in the next input line if there is
no argument to
<B>SH</B>)

in bold face, one size larger than the base document size.
Additionally, the left margin for the following text is reset to its default
value.
<DT><B>.SS [</B><I>text for a heading</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets up an secondary, unnumbered section heading.
Prints out all the text following
<B>SS</B>

up to the end of the line (resp. the text in the next input line if there is
no argument to
<B>SS</B>)

in bold face, at the same size as the base document size.
Additionally, the left margin for the following text is reset to its default
value.
<DT><B>.TP [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets up an indented paragraph with label.
The indentation is set to
<I>nnn</I>

if that argument is supplied (the default unit is `n' if omitted), otherwise
it is set to the default indentation value.
The first input line of text following this macro is interpreted as a string
to be printed flush-left, as it is appropriate for a label.
It is not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is no attempt to fill
the first line with text from the following input lines.
Nevertheless, if the label is not as wide as the indentation, then the
paragraph starts at the same line (but indented), continuing on the
following lines.
If the label is wider than the indentation, then the descriptive part of the
paragraph begins on the line following the label, entirely indented.
Note that neither font shape nor font size of the label is set to a default
value; on the other hand, the rest of the text will have default font
settings.
The
<B>TP</B>

macro is the macro used for the explanations you are just reading.
<DT><B>.LP</B>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>.PP</B>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>.P</B>

<DD>These macros are mutual aliases.
Any of them causes a line break at the current position, followed by a
vertical space downwards by the amount specified by the
<B>PD</B>

macro.
The font size and shape are reset to the default value (10pt resp. Roman).
Finally, the current left margin is restored.
<DT><B>.IP [</B><I>designator</I><B>] [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets up an indented paragraph, using
<I>designator</I>

as a tag to mark its beginning.
The indentation is set to
<I>nnn</I>

if that argument is supplied (default unit is `n'), otherwise the default
indentation value is used.
Font size and face of the paragraph (but not the designator) are reset to
its default values.
To start an indented paragraph with a particular indentation but without a
designator, use `&quot;&quot;' (two doublequotes) as the second argument.
<DT><DD>
For example, the following paragraphs were all set up with bullets as the
designator, using `.IP&nbsp;\(bu&nbsp;4':
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>IP</B>

is one of the three macros used in the
<B>man</B>

package to format lists.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>HP</B>

is another.
This macro produces a paragraph with a left hanging indentation.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>TP</B>

is another.
This macro produces an unindented label followed by an indented paragraph.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>.HP [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Sets up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.
The indentation is set to
<I>nnn</I>

if that argument is supplied (default unit is `n'), otherwise the default
indentation value is used.
Font size and face are reset to its default values.
The following paragraph illustrates the effect of this macro with hanging
indentation set to&nbsp;4:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>This is a paragraph following an invocation of the
<B>HP</B>

macro.
As you can see, it produces a paragraph where all lines but the first are
indented.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>.RS [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
This macro moves the left margin to the right by the value
<I>nnn</I>

if specified (default unit is `n'); otherwise the default indentation value
is used.
Calls to the
<B>RS</B>

macro can be nested.
<DT><B>.RE [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
This macro moves the left margin back to level
<I>nnn</I>;

if no argument is given, it moves one level back.
The first level (i.e., no call to
<B>RS</B>

yet) has number&nbsp;1, and each call to
<B>RS</B>

increases the level by&nbsp;1.
</DL>
<P>

To summarize, the following macros cause a line break with the insertion of
vertical space (which amount can be changed with the
<B>PD</B>

macro):
<B>SH</B>,

<B>SS</B>,

<B>TP</B>,

<B>LP</B>

(<B>PP</B>,

<B>P</B>),

<B>IP</B>,

and
<B>HP</B>.

The macros
<B>RS</B>

and
<B>RE</B>

also cause a break but no insertion of vertical space.
Finally, the macros
<B>SH</B>,

<B>SS</B>,

<B>LP</B>

(<B>PP</B>,

<B>P</B>),

and
<B>RS</B>

reset the indentation to its default value.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MACROS TO SET FONTS</H2>

The standard font is Roman; the default text size is 10&nbsp;point.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.SM [</B><I>text</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Causes the text on the same line or the text on the next input line to
appear in a font that is one point size smaller than the default font.
<DT><B>.SB [</B><I>text</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Causes the text on the same line or the text on the next input line to
appear in boldface font, one point size smaller than the default font.
<DT><B>.BI </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in bold face and italic.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
Thus
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
.BI this &quot;word and&quot; that
</DL>
<P>

would cause `this' and `that' to appear in bold face, while `word and'
appears in italics.
</DL>

<DT><B>.IB </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text to appear alternately in italic and bold face.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
<DT><B>.RI </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in roman and italic.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
<DT><B>.IR </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in italic and roman.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
<DT><B>.BR </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in bold face and roman.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
<DT><B>.RB </B><I>text</I>

<DD>
Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in roman and bold face.
The text must be on the same line as the macro call.
<DT><B>.B [</B><I>text</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Causes
<I>text</I>

to appear in bold face.
If no text is present on the line where the macro is called, then the text
of the next input line appears in bold face.
<DT><B>.I [</B><I>text</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Causes
<I>text</I>

to appear in italic.
If no text is present on the line where the macro is called, then the text
of the next input line appears in italic.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MISCELLANEOUS</H2>

The default indentation is 7.2n for all output devices except for
<B>grohtml</B>

which ignores indentation.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.DT</B>

<DD>
Sets tabs every 0.5 inches.
Since this macro is always called during a
<B>TH</B>

request, it makes sense to call it only if the tab positions have been
changed.
<DT><B>.PD [</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Adjusts the empty space before a new paragraph (resp. section).
The optional argument gives the amount of space (default units are `v');
without parameter, the value is reset to its default value (1&nbsp;line for tty
devices, 0.4v&nbsp;otherwise).
This affects the macros
<B>SH</B>,

<B>SS</B>,

<B>TP</B>,

<B>LP</B>

(resp.
<B>PP</B>

and
<B>P</B>),

<B>IP</B>,

and
<B>HP</B>.

</DL>
<P>

The following strings are defined:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>\*S</B>

<DD>
Switch back to the default font size.
<DT><B>\*R</B>

<DD>
The `registered' sign.
<DT><B>\*(Tm</B>

<DD>
The `trademark' sign.
<DT><B>\*(lq</B>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>\*(rq</B>

<DD>Left and right quote.
This is equal to `\(lq' and `\(rq', respectively.
</DL>
<P>

If a preprocessor like
<B>tbl</B>

or
<B>eqn</B>

is needed, it has become usage to make the first line of the man page look
like this:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>.\&nbsp; word</B>

</DL>

<P>

Note the single space character after the double quote.
<I>word</I>

consists of letters for the needed preprocessors: `e' for
<B>eqn</B>,

`r' for
<B>refer</B>,

and `t' for
<B>tbl</B>.

Modern implementations of the
<B>man</B>

program read this first line and automatically call the right
preprocessor(s).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>man.tmac</B>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>an.tmac</B>

<DD>These are wrapper files to call
<B>andoc.tmac</B>.

<DT><B>andoc.tmac</B>

<DD>
This file checks whether the
<B>man</B>

macros or the
<B>mdoc</B>

package should be used.
<DT><B>an-old.tmac</B>

<DD>
All
<B>man</B>

macros are contained in this file.
<DT><B>man.local</B>

<DD>
Local changes and customizations should be put into this file.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SEE ALSO</H2>

Since the
<B>man</B>

macros consist of groups of
<I>groff</I>

requests, one can, in principle, supplement the functionality of the
<B>man</B>

macros with individual
<I>groff</I>

requests where necessary.
A complete list of these requests is available on the WWW at
