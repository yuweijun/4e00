ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT - roll back to a savepoint
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] <I>savepoint_name</I>

</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was
established. The savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to
again later, if needed.
<P>

<B>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</B> implicitly destroys all savepoints that
were established after the named savepoint.

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B></B><I>savepoint_name</I><B></B><DD>
The savepoint to roll back to.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

Use RELEASE SAVEPOINT [<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+release_savepoint">release_savepoint</A></B>(7)] to destroy a savepoint without
discarding the effects of commands executed after it was established.
<P>

Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.
<P>

Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to
savepoints. Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed
when the savepoint is rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is
affected by a 
<B>FETCH</B> command inside a savepoint that is later rolled
back, the cursor position remains at the position that <B>FETCH</B>
left it pointing to (that is, <B>FETCH</B> is not rolled back).
Closing a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either.
A cursor whose execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a
cannot-execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using
<B>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</B>, the cursor can no longer be used.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

To undo the effects of the commands executed after my_savepoint
was established:
<P>
<PRE>
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

</PRE>

<P>

Cursor positions are not affected by savepoint rollback:
<P>
<PRE>
BEGIN;

DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2;

SAVEPOINT foo;

FETCH 1 FROM foo;
 ?column? 
----------
        1

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT foo;

FETCH 1 FROM foo;
 ?column? 
----------
        2

COMMIT;

</PRE>

<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

The SQL standard specifies that the key word
SAVEPOINT is mandatory, but PostgreSQL
and Oracle allow it to be omitted. SQL allows
only WORK, not TRANSACTION, as a noise word
after ROLLBACK. Also, SQL has an optional clause
AND [ NO ] CHAIN which is not currently supported by
PostgreSQL. Otherwise, this command conforms to
the SQL standard.
