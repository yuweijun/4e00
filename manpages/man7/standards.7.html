<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The CONFORMING TO section that appears in many manual pages identifies
various standards to which the documented interface conforms.
The following list briefly describes these standards.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>V7</B>

<DD>
Version 7, the ancestral UNIX from Bell Labs.
<DT><B>4.2BSD</B>

<DD>
This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2 release
of the
<I>Berkeley Software Distribution,</I>

released by the University of California at Berkeley.
This was the first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP
stack and the sockets API.
4.2BSD was released in 1983.
<P>
Earlier major BSD releases included <I>3BSD</I> (1980), <I>4BSD</I> (1980),
and <I>4.1BSD</I> (1981).
<DT><B>4.3BSD</B>

<DD>
The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.
<DT><B>4.4BSD</B>

<DD>
The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993.
This was the last major Berkeley release.
<DT><B>System V</B>

<DD>
This is an implementation standard defined by AT&amp;T's milestone 1983
release of its commercial System V (five) release.
The previous major AT&amp;T release was
<I>System III</I>,

released in 1981.
<DT><B>System V release 2 (SVr2)</B>

<DD>
This was the next System V release, made in 1985.
The SVr2 was formally described in the
<I>System V Interface Definition version 1</I>

(<I>SVID 1</I>)

published in 1985.
<DT><B>System V release 3 (SVr3)</B>

<DD>
This was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986.
This release was formally described in the
<I>System V Interface Definition version 2</I>

(<I>SVID 2</I>).

<DT><B>System V release 4 (SVr4)</B>

<DD>
This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989.
This version of System V is described in the &quot;Programmer's Reference
Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)&quot; (Prentice-Hall
1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2)
This release was formally described in the
<I>System V Interface Definition version 3</I>

(<I>SVID 3</I>),

and is considered the definitive System V release.
<DT><B>SVID 4</B>

<DD>
System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995.
Available online at <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/">http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/</A> .
<DT><B>C89</B>

<DD>
This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) in 1989
(<I>X3.159-1989</I>).

Sometimes this is known as
<I>ANSI C</I>,

but since C99 is also an
ANSI standard, this term is ambiguous.
This standard was also ratified by
ISO (International Standards Organization) in 1990
(<I>ISO/IEC 9899:1990</I>),

and is thus occasionally referred to as
<I>ISO C90</I>.

<DT><B>C99</B>

<DD>
This revision of the C language standard was ratified by ISO in 1999
(<I>ISO/IEC 9899:1999</I>).

Available online at
<A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.</A>
<DT><B>POSIX.1-1990</B>

<DD>
&quot;Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Environments&quot;.
IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1, ratified by ISO in 1990
(<I>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990</I>).

The term &quot;POSIX&quot; was coined by Richard Stallman.
<DT><B>POSIX.2</B>

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.2-1992,
describing commands and utilities, ratified by ISO in 1993
(<I>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993</I>).

<DT><B>POSIX.1b</B> (formerly known as <I>POSIX.4</I>)

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993
describing real-time facilities
for portable operating systems, ratified by ISO in 1996
(<I>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996</I>).

<DT><B>POSIX.1c</B>

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995 describing the POSIX threads interfaces.
<DT><B>POSIX.1d</B>

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.1c-1999 describing additional real-time extensions.
<DT><B>POSIX.1g</B>

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000 describing networking APIs (including sockets).
<DT><B>POSIX.1j</B>

<DD>
IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000 describing advanced real-time extensions.
<DT><B>POSIX.1-1996</B>

<DD>
A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and POSIX.1c.
<DT><B>XPG3</B>

<DD>
Released in 1989, this was the first significant release of the
<I>X/Open Portability Guide</I>,

produced by the
X/Open Company, a multi-vendor consortium.
This multi-volume guide was based on the POSIX standards.
<DT><B>XPG4</B>

<DD>
A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in 1992.
<DT><B>XPG4v2</B>

<DD>
A 1994 revision of XPG4.
This is also referred to as
<I>Spec 1170</I>,

where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces
defined by this standard.
<DT><B>SUS  (SUSv1)</B>

<DD>
Single UNIX Specification.
This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards
(X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2,
X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4).
Systems conforming to this standard can be branded
<I>UNIX 95</I>.

<DT><B>SUSv2</B>

<DD>
Single UNIX Specification version 2.
Sometimes also referred to as
<I>XPG5</I>.

This standard appeared in 1997.
Systems conforming to this standard can be branded
<I>UNIX 98</I>.

See also
<A HREF="http://www.UNIX-systems.org/version2/">http://www.UNIX-systems.org/version2/</A> .)
<DT><B>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</B>

<DD>
This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the
POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document,
conducted under the auspices of the Austin group
(<A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</A> .)
The standard is available online at
<A HREF="http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/">http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/</A> ,
and the interfaces that it describes are also available in the Linux
manual pages package under sections 1p and 3p (e.g., &quot;man 3p open&quot;).
<P>
The standard defines two levels of conformance:
<I>POSIX conformance</I>,

which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a conforming system;
and
<I>XSI Conformance,</I>

which additionally mandates a set of interfaces
(the &quot;XSI extension&quot;) which are only optional for POSIX conformance.
XSI-conformant systems can be branded
<I>UNIX 03</I>.

(XSI conformance constitutes the
<I>Single UNIX Specification version 3</I>

(<I>SUSv3</I>).)

<P>
The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:
<P>
<B>XBD</B>:

Definitions, terms and concepts, header file specifications.
<P>
<B>XSH</B>:

Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library
functions in actual implementations).
<P>
<B>XCU</B>:

Specifications of commands and utilities
(i.e., the area formerly described by POSIX.2).
<P>
<B>XRAT</B>:

Informative text on the other parts of the standard.
<P>
POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the
library functions standardized in C99 are also
standardized in POSIX.1-2001.
<P>
Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements)
of the original 2001 standard have occurred:
TC1 in 2003 (referred to as
<I>POSIX.1-2003</I>),

and TC2 in 2004 (referred to as
<I>POSIX.1-2004</I>).

<DT><B>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</B>

<DD>
Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and
ratified in 2008.
<P>
The changes in this revision are not as large as those
that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3,
but a number of new interfaces are added
and various details of existing specifications are modified.
Many of the interfaces that were optional in
POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of the standard.
A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked
as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.
<P>
The revised standard is broken into the same four parts as POSIX.1-2001,
and again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline
<I>POSIX Conformance</I>,

and
<I>XSI Conformance</I>,

which mandates an additional set of interfaces
beyond those in the base specification.
<P>
In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual page
lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also
conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.
