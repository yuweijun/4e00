<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>


<PRE>
    $time = timelocal($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year);
    $time = timegm($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year);

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
This module provides functions that are the inverse of built-in perl
functions <TT>&quot;localtime()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;gmtime()&quot;</TT>. They accept a date as a
six-element array, and return the corresponding <TT><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+time">time</A>(2)</TT> value in
seconds since the system epoch (Midnight, January 1, 1970 <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT> on Unix,
for example). This value can be positive or negative, though <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>
only requires support for positive values, so dates before the
system's epoch may not work on all operating systems.
<P>

It is worth drawing particular attention to the expected ranges for
the values provided. The value for the day of the month is the actual
day (ie 1..31), while the month is the number of months since January
(0..11). This is consistent with the values returned from
<TT>&quot;localtime()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;gmtime()&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>timelocal() and timegm()</H3>



<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
This module exports two functions by default, <TT>&quot;timelocal()&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;timegm()&quot;</TT>.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;timelocal()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;timegm()&quot;</TT> functions perform range checking on
the input <TT>$sec</TT>, <TT>$min</TT>, <TT>$hour</TT>, <TT>$mday</TT>, and <TT>$mon</TT> values by default.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>timelocal_nocheck() and timegm_nocheck()</H3>



<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
If you are working with data you know to be valid, you can speed your
code up by using the ``nocheck'' variants, <TT>&quot;timelocal_nocheck()&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;timegm_nocheck()&quot;</TT>. These variants must be explicitly imported.
<P>



<PRE>
    use Time::Local 'timelocal_nocheck';

    # The 365th day of 1999
    print scalar localtime timelocal_nocheck 0,0,0,365,0,99;

</PRE>


<P>

If you supply data which is not valid (month 27, second 1,000) the
results will be unpredictable (so don't do that).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Year Value Interpretation</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Strictly speaking, the year should be specified in a form consistent
with <TT>&quot;localtime()&quot;</TT>, i.e. the offset from 1900. In order to make the
interpretation of the year easier for humans, however, who are more
accustomed to seeing years as two-digit or four-digit values, the
following conventions are followed:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Years greater than 999 are interpreted as being the actual year,
rather than the offset from 1900. Thus, 1964 would indicate the year
Martin Luther King won the Nobel prize, not the year 3864.
<DT>*<DD>
Years in the range 100..999 are interpreted as offset from 1900, so
that 112 indicates 2012. This rule also applies to years less than
zero (but see note below regarding date range).
<DT>*<DD>
Years in the range 0..99 are interpreted as shorthand for years in the
rolling ``current century,'' defined as 50 years on either side of the
current year. Thus, today, in 1999, 0 would refer to 2000, and 45 to
2045, but 55 would refer to 1955. Twenty years from now, 55 would
instead refer to 2055. This is messy, but matches the way people
currently think about two digit dates. Whenever possible, use an
absolute four digit year instead.
</DL>
<P>

The scheme above allows interpretation of a wide range of dates,
particularly if 4-digit years are used.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Limits of time_t</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
The range of dates that can be actually be handled depends on the size
of <TT>&quot;time_t&quot;</TT> (usually a signed integer) on the given
platform. Currently, this is 32 bits for most systems, yielding an
approximate range from Dec 1901 to Jan 2038.
<P>

Both <TT>&quot;timelocal()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;timegm()&quot;</TT> croak if given dates outside the
supported range.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ambiguous Local Times (<FONT SIZE="-1">DST</FONT>)</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Because of <FONT SIZE="-1">DST</FONT> changes, there are many time zones where the same local
time occurs for two different <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT> times on the same day. For example,
in the ``Europe/Paris'' time zone, the local time of 2001-10-28 02:30:00
can represent either 2001-10-28 00:30:00 <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT>, <B>or</B> 2001-10-28
01:30:00 <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT>.
<P>

When given an ambiguous local time, the <I>timelocal()</I> function should
always return the epoch for the <I>earlier</I> of the two possible <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT>
times.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Non-Existent Local Times (<FONT SIZE="-1">DST</FONT>)</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
When a <FONT SIZE="-1">DST</FONT> change causes a locale clock to skip one hour forward,
there will be an hour's worth of local times that don't exist. Again,
for the ``Europe/Paris'' time zone, the local clock jumped from
2001-03-25 01:59:59 to 2001-03-25 03:00:00.
<P>

If the <TT>&quot;timelocal()&quot;</TT> function is given a non-existent local time, it
will simply return an epoch value for the time one hour later.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Negative Epoch Values</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Negative epoch (<TT>&quot;time_t&quot;</TT>) values are not officially supported by the
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> standards, so this module's tests do not test them. On some
systems, they are known not to work. These include MacOS (pre-OSX) and
Win32.
<P>

On systems which do support negative epoch values, this module should
be able to cope with dates before the start of the epoch, down the
minimum value of time_t for the system.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IMPLEMENTATION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
These routines are quite efficient and yet are always guaranteed to
agree with <TT>&quot;localtime()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;gmtime()&quot;</TT>. We manage this by caching
the start times of any months we've seen before. If we know the start
time of the month, we can always calculate any time within the month.
The start times are calculated using a mathematical formula. Unlike
other algorithms that do multiple calls to <TT>&quot;gmtime()&quot;</TT>.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;timelocal()&quot;</TT> function is implemented using the same cache. We
just assume that we're translating a <FONT SIZE="-1">GMT</FONT> time, and then fudge it when
we're done for the timezone and daylight savings arguments. Note that
the timezone is evaluated for each date because countries occasionally
change their official timezones. Assuming that <TT>&quot;localtime()&quot;</TT> corrects
for these changes, this routine will also be correct.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
The whole scheme for interpreting two-digit years can be considered a
bug.
