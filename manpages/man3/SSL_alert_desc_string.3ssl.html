<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
<I>SSL_alert_type_string()</I> returns a one letter string indicating the
type of the alert specified by <B>value</B>.
<P>

<I>SSL_alert_type_string_long()</I> returns a string indicating the type of the alert
specified by <B>value</B>.
<P>

<I>SSL_alert_desc_string()</I> returns a two letter string as a short form
describing the reason of the alert specified by <B>value</B>.
<P>

<I>SSL_alert_desc_string_long()</I> returns a string describing the reason

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
When one side of an <FONT SIZE="-1">SSL/TLS</FONT> communication wants to inform the peer about
a special situation, it sends an alert. The alert is sent as a special message
and does not influence the normal data stream (unless its contents results
in the communication being canceled).
<P>

A warning alert is sent, when a non-fatal error condition occurs. The
``close notify'' alert is sent as a warning alert. Other examples for
non-fatal errors are certificate errors (``certificate expired'',
``unsupported certificate''), for which a warning alert may be sent.
(The sending party may however decide to send a fatal error.) The
receiving side may cancel the connection on reception of a warning
alert on it discretion.
<P>

Several alert messages must be sent as fatal alert messages as specified
by the <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">RFC</FONT>. A fatal alert always leads to a connection abort.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The following strings can occur for <I>SSL_alert_type_string()</I> or
<I>SSL_alert_type_string_long()</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>W/warning<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>

<DT>F/fatal<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
<DT>U/unknown<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>

This indicates that no support is available for this alert type.
Probably <B>value</B> does not contain a correct alert message.
</DL>
<P>

The following strings can occur for <I>SSL_alert_desc_string()</I> or
<I>SSL_alert_desc_string_long()</I>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CN</FONT>/close notify<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
The connection shall be closed. This is a warning alert.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">UM</FONT>/unexpected message<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
An inappropriate message was received. This alert is always fatal
and should never be observed in communication between proper
implementations.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">BM</FONT>/bad record mac<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
This alert is returned if a record is received with an incorrect
<FONT SIZE="-1">MAC</FONT>. This message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">DF</FONT>/decompression failure<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
The decompression function received improper input (e.g. data
that would expand to excessive length). This message is always
fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">HF</FONT>/handshake failure<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
Reception of a handshake_failure alert message indicates that the
sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security
parameters given the options available. This is a fatal error.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">NC</FONT>/no certificate<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
A client, that was asked to send a certificate, does not send a certificate
(SSLv3 only).
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">BC</FONT>/bad certificate<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures that did not
verify correctly, etc
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">UC</FONT>/unsupported certificate<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
A certificate was of an unsupported type.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CR</FONT>/certificate revoked<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
A certificate was revoked by its signer.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CE</FONT>/certificate expired<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
A certificate has expired or is not currently valid.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CU</FONT>/certificate unknown<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
Some other (unspecified) issue arose in processing the
certificate, rendering it unacceptable.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">IP</FONT>/illegal parameter<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
A field in the handshake was out of range or inconsistent with
other fields. This is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>/decryption failed<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
A TLSCiphertext decrypted in an invalid way: either it wasn't an
even multiple of the block length or its padding values, when
checked, weren't correct. This message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">RO</FONT>/record overflow<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
A TLSCiphertext record was received which had a length more than
2^14+2048 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record
with more than 2^14+1024 bytes. This message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>/unknown <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
A valid certificate chain or partial chain was received, but the
certificate was not accepted because the <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT> certificate could not
be located or couldn't be matched with a known, trusted <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>.  This
message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">AD</FONT>/access denied<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
A valid certificate was received, but when access control was
applied, the sender decided not to proceed with negotiation.
This message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">DE</FONT>/decode error<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
A message could not be decoded because some field was out of the
specified range or the length of the message was incorrect. This
message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">CY</FONT>/decrypt error<DD>


<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
A handshake cryptographic operation failed, including being
unable to correctly verify a signature, decrypt a key exchange,
or validate a finished message.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">ER</FONT>/export restriction<DD>


<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
A negotiation not in compliance with export restrictions was
detected; for example, attempting to transfer a 1024 bit
ephemeral <FONT SIZE="-1">RSA</FONT> key for the <FONT SIZE="-1">RSA_EXPORT</FONT> handshake method. This
message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">PV</FONT>/protocol version<DD>


<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
The protocol version the client has attempted to negotiate is
recognized, but not supported. (For example, old protocol
versions might be avoided for security reasons). This message is
always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">IS</FONT>/insufficient security<DD>


<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
Returned instead of handshake_failure when a negotiation has
failed specifically because the server requires ciphers more
secure than those supported by the client. This message is always
fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">IE</FONT>/internal error<DD>


<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
An internal error unrelated to the peer or the correctness of the
protocol makes it impossible to continue (such as a memory
allocation failure). This message is always fatal.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">US</FONT>/user canceled<DD>


<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
This handshake is being canceled for some reason unrelated to a
protocol failure. If the user cancels an operation after the
handshake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a
close_notify is more appropriate. This alert should be followed
by a close_notify. This message is generally a warning.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">NR</FONT>/no renegotiation<DD>


<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
Sent by the client in response to a hello request or by the
server in response to a client hello after initial handshaking.
Either of these would normally lead to renegotiation; when that
is not appropriate, the recipient should respond with this alert;
at that point, the original requester can decide whether to
proceed with the connection. One case where this would be
appropriate would be where a server has spawned a process to
satisfy a request; the process might receive security parameters
(key length, authentication, etc.) at startup and it might be
difficult to communicate changes to these parameters after that
point. This message is always a warning.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">UK</FONT>/unknown<DD>


<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
This indicates that no description is available for this alert type.
Probably <B>value</B> does not contain a correct alert message.
