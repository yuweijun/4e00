<PRE>
    use File::CheckTree;

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The <I>validate()</I> routine takes a single multiline string consisting of
directives, each containing a filename plus a file test to try on it.
(The file test may also be a ``cd'', causing subsequent relative filenames
to be interpreted relative to that directory.)  After the file test
you may put <TT>&quot;|| die&quot;</TT> to make it a fatal error if the file test fails.
The default is <TT>&quot;|| warn&quot;</TT>.  The file test may optionally have a &quot;!' prepended
to test for the opposite condition.  If you do a cd and then list some
relative filenames, you may want to indent them slightly for readability.
If you supply your own <I>die()</I> or <I>warn()</I> message, you can use <TT>$file</TT> to
interpolate the filename.
<P>

Filetests may be bunched:  ``-rwx'' tests for all of <TT>&quot;-r&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;-w&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;-x&quot;</TT>.
Only the first failed test of the bunch will produce a warning.
<P>

The routine returns the number of warnings issued.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
File::CheckTree was derived from lib/validate.pl which was
written by Larry Wall.
Revised by Paul Grassie &lt;<I><A HREF="mailto:grassie@perl.com">grassie@perl.com</A></I>&gt; in 2002.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
File::CheckTree used to not display fatal error messages.
It used to count only those warnings produced by a generic <TT>&quot;|| warn&quot;</TT>
(and not those in which the user supplied the message).  In addition,
the <I>validate()</I> routine would leave the user program in whatever
directory was last entered through the use of ``cd'' directives.
These bugs were fixed during the development of perl 5.8.
The first fixed version of File::CheckTree was 4.2.
