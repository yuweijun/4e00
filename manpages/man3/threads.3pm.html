<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Since Perl 5.8, thread programming has been available using a model called
<I>interpreter threads</I> which provides a new Perl interpreter for each
thread, and, by default, results in no data or state information being shared
between threads.
<P>

(Prior to Perl 5.8, <I>5005threads</I> was available through the <TT>&quot;Thread.pm&quot;</TT> <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>.
This threading model has been deprecated, and was removed as of Perl 5.10.0.)
<P>

As just mentioned, all variables are, by default, thread local.  To use shared
variables, you need to also load threads::shared:
<P>



<PRE>
    use threads;
    use threads::shared;

</PRE>


<P>

When loading threads::shared, you must <TT>&quot;use threads&quot;</TT> before you
<TT>&quot;use threads::shared&quot;</TT>.  (<TT>&quot;threads&quot;</TT> will emit a warning if you do it the
other way around.)
<P>

It is strongly recommended that you enable threads via <TT>&quot;use threads&quot;</TT> as early
as possible in your script.
<P>

If needed, scripts can be written so as to run on both threaded and
non-threaded Perls:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $can_use_threads = eval 'use threads; 1';
    if ($can_use_threads) {
        # Do processing using threads
        ...
    } else {
        # Do it without using threads
        ...
    }

</PRE>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>$thr = threads-&gt;create(<FONT SIZE="-1">FUNCTION</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">ARGS</FONT>)<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
This will create a new thread that will begin execution with the specified
entry point function, and give it the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>ARGS</I></FONT><I></I> list as parameters.  It will
return the corresponding threads object, or <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> if thread creation failed.


<P>


<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>FUNCTION</I></FONT><I></I> may either be the name of a function, an anonymous subroutine, or
a code ref.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create('func_name', ...);
        # or
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(sub { ... }, ...);
        # or
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;func, ...);

</PRE>




<P>


The <TT>&quot;-&gt;new()&quot;</TT> method is an alias for <TT>&quot;-&gt;create()&quot;</TT>.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>join()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
This will wait for the corresponding thread to complete its execution.  When
the thread finishes, <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> will return the return value(s) of the
entry point function.


<P>


The context (void, scalar or list) for the return value(s) for <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT>
is determined at the time of thread creation.


<P>




<PRE>
    # Create thread in list context (implicit)
    my ($thr1) = threads-&gt;create(sub {
                                    my @results = qw(a b c);
                                    return (@results);
                                 });
    #   or (explicit)
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'list'},
                               sub {
                                    my @results = qw(a b c);
                                    return (@results);
                               });
    # Retrieve list results from thread
    my @res1 = $thr1-&gt;join();

    # Create thread in scalar context (implicit)
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(sub {
                                    my $result = 42;
                                    return ($result);
                                 });
    # Retrieve scalar result from thread
    my $res2 = $thr2-&gt;join();

    # Create a thread in void context (explicit)
    my $thr3 = threads-&gt;create({'void' =&gt; 1},
                               sub { print(&quot;Hello, world\n&quot;); });
    # Join the thread in void context (i.e., no return value)
    $thr3-&gt;join();

</PRE>




<P>


See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">THREAD</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">CONTEXT</FONT>'' for more details.


<P>


If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.


<P>


Calling <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;-&gt;detach()&quot;</TT> on an already joined thread will
cause an error to be thrown.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>detach()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Makes the thread unjoinable, and causes any eventual return value to be
discarded.  When the program exits, any detached threads that are still
running are silently terminated.


<P>


If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.


<P>


Calling <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;-&gt;detach()&quot;</TT> on an already detached thread
will cause an error to be thrown.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>detach()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
Class method that allows a thread to detach itself.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>self()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own <I>threads</I> object.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>tid()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Returns the <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> of the thread.  Thread IDs are unique integers with the main
thread in a program being 0, and incrementing by 1 for every thread created.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>tid()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT>.
<DT>$thr<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
If you add the <TT>&quot;stringify&quot;</TT> import option to your <TT>&quot;use threads&quot;</TT> declaration,
then using a threads object in a string or a string context (e.g., as a hash
key) will cause its <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> to be used as the value:


<P>




<PRE>
    use threads qw(stringify);

    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(...);
    print(&quot;Thread $thr started...\n&quot;);  # Prints out: Thread 1 started...

</PRE>


<DT>threads-&gt;object($tid)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
This will return the <I>threads</I> object for the <I>active</I> thread associated
with the specified thread <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT>.  If <TT>$tid</TT> is the value for the current thread,
then this call works the same as <TT>&quot;-&gt;self()&quot;</TT>.  Otherwise, returns <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT>
if there is no thread associated with the <FONT SIZE="-1">TID</FONT>, if the thread is joined or
detached, if no <FONT SIZE="-1">TID</FONT> is specified or if the specified <FONT SIZE="-1">TID</FONT> is undef.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>yield()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
This is a suggestion to the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> to let this thread yield <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> time to other
threads.  What actually happens is highly dependent upon the underlying
thread implementation.


<P>


You may do <TT>&quot;use threads qw(yield)&quot;</TT>, and then just use <TT>&quot;yield()&quot;</TT> in your
code.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>list()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>

<DT>threads-&gt;list(threads::all)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
<DT>threads-&gt;list(threads::running)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
<DT>threads-&gt;list(threads::joinable)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>

With no arguments (or using <TT>&quot;threads::all&quot;</TT>) and in a list context, returns a
list of all non-joined, non-detached <I>threads</I> objects.  In a scalar context,
returns a count of the same.


<P>


With a <I>true</I> argument (using <TT>&quot;threads::running&quot;</TT>), returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached <I>threads</I> objects that are still running.


<P>


With a <I>false</I> argument (using <TT>&quot;threads::joinable&quot;</TT>), returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached <I>threads</I> objects that have finished running (i.e.,
for which <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> will not <I>block</I>).
<DT>$thr1-&gt;equal($thr2)<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
Tests if two threads objects are the same thread or not.  This is overloaded
to the more natural forms:


<P>




<PRE>
    if ($thr1 == $thr2) {
        print(&quot;Threads are the same\n&quot;);
    }
    # or
    if ($thr1 != $thr2) {
        print(&quot;Threads differ\n&quot;);
    }

</PRE>




<P>


(Thread comparison is based on thread IDs.)
<DT>async <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT>;<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
<TT>&quot;async&quot;</TT> creates a thread to execute the block immediately following
it.  This block is treated as an anonymous subroutine, and so must have a
semicolon after the closing brace.  Like <TT>&quot;threads-&gt;create()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;async&quot;</TT>
returns a <I>threads</I> object.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>error()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
Threads are executed in an <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT> context.  This method will return <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT>
if the thread terminates <I>normally</I>.  Otherwise, it returns the value of
<TT>$@</TT> associated with the thread's execution status in its <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT> context.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>_handle()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
This <I>private</I> method returns the memory location of the internal thread
structure associated with a threads object.  For Win32, this is a pointer to
the <TT>&quot;HANDLE&quot;</TT> value returned by <TT>&quot;CreateThread&quot;</TT> (i.e., <TT>&quot;HANDLE *&quot;</TT>); for other
platforms, it is a pointer to the <TT>&quot;pthread_t&quot;</TT> structure used in the
<TT>&quot;pthread_create&quot;</TT> call (i.e., <TT>&quot;pthread_t *&quot;</TT>).


<P>


This method is of no use for general Perl threads programming.  Its intent is
to provide other (XS-based) thread modules with the capability to access, and
possibly manipulate, the underlying thread structure associated with a Perl
thread.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>_handle()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own <I>handle</I>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXITING A THREAD</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
The usual method for terminating a thread is to
<I>return()</I> from the entry point function with the
appropriate return value(s).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>exit()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
If needed, a thread can be exited at any time by calling
<TT>&quot;threads-&gt;exit()&quot;</TT>.  This will cause the thread to return <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> in a
scalar context, or the empty list in a list context.


<P>


When called from the <I>main</I> thread, this behaves the same as <TT>exit(0)</TT>.
<DT>threads-&gt;exit(status)<DD>
<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
When called from a thread, this behaves like <TT>&quot;threads-&gt;exit()&quot;</TT> (i.e., the
exit status code is ignored).


<P>


When called from the <I>main</I> thread, this behaves the same as <TT>&quot;exit(status)&quot;</TT>.
<DT><I>die()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
Calling <TT>&quot;die()&quot;</TT> in a thread indicates an abnormal exit for the thread.  Any
<TT>$SIG{__DIE__}</TT> handler in the thread will be called first, and then the
thread will exit with a warning message that will contain any arguments passed
in the <TT>&quot;die()&quot;</TT> call.
<DT>exit(status)<DD>
<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
Calling <I>exit()</I> inside a thread causes the whole
application to terminate.  Because of this, the use of <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> inside
threaded code, or in modules that might be used in threaded applications, is
strongly discouraged.


<P>


If <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> really is needed, then consider using the following:


<P>




<PRE>
    threads-&gt;exit() if threads-&gt;can('exit');   # Thread friendly
    exit(status);

</PRE>


<DT>use threads 'exit' =&gt; 'threads_only'<DD>
<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
This globally overrides the default behavior of calling <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> inside a
thread, and effectively causes such calls to behave the same as
<TT>&quot;threads-&gt;exit()&quot;</TT>.  In other words, with this setting, calling <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT>
causes only the thread to terminate.


<P>


Because of its global effect, this setting should not be used inside modules
or the like.


<P>


The <I>main</I> thread is unaffected by this setting.
<DT>threads-&gt;create({'exit' =&gt; 'thread_only'}, ...)<DD>
<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
This overrides the default behavior of <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> inside the newly created
thread only.
<DT>$thr-&gt;set_thread_exit_only(boolean)<DD>


<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
This can be used to change the <I>exit thread only</I> behavior for a thread after
it has been created.  With a <I>true</I> argument, <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> will cause only the
thread to exit.  With a <I>false</I> argument, <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT> will terminate the
application.


<P>


The <I>main</I> thread is unaffected by this call.
<DT>threads-&gt;set_thread_exit_only(boolean)<DD>
<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
Class method for use inside a thread to change its own behavior for <TT>&quot;exit()&quot;</TT>.


<P>


The <I>main</I> thread is unaffected by this call.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THREAD STATE</H2>

<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
The following boolean methods are useful in determining the <I>state</I> of a
thread.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>is_running()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
Returns true if a thread is still running (i.e., if its entry point function
has not yet finished or exited).
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>is_joinable()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
Returns true if the thread has finished running, is not detached and has not
yet been joined.  In other words, the thread is ready to be joined, and a call
to <TT>&quot;$thr-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> will not <I>block</I>.
<DT>$thr-&gt;<I>is_detached()</I><DD>


<A NAME="ixABK"></A>
Returns true if the thread has been detached.
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>is_detached()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixABL"></A>
Class method that allows a thread to determine whether or not it is detached.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THREAD CONTEXT</H2>

<A NAME="ixABM"></A>
As with subroutines, the type of value returned from a thread's entry point
function may be determined by the thread's <I>context</I>:  list, scalar or void.
The thread's context is determined at thread creation.  This is necessary so
that the context is available to the entry point function via
<I>wantarray()</I>.  The thread may then specify a value of
the appropriate type to be returned from <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Explicit context</H3>

<A NAME="ixABN"></A>
Because thread creation and thread joining may occur in different contexts, it
may be desirable to state the context explicitly to the thread's entry point
function.  This may be done by calling <TT>&quot;-&gt;create()&quot;</TT> with a hash reference
as the first argument:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'list'}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    my @results = $thr-&gt;join();

</PRE>


<P>

In the above, the threads object is returned to the parent thread in scalar
context, and the thread's entry point function <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> will be called in list
(array) context such that the parent thread can receive a list (array) from
the <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> call.  (<TT>'array'</TT> is synonymous with <TT>'list'</TT>.)
<P>

Similarly, if you need the threads object, but your thread will not be
returning a value (i.e., <I>void</I> context), you would do the following:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'void'}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    $thr-&gt;join();

</PRE>


<P>

The context type may also be used as the <I>key</I> in the hash reference followed
by a <I>true</I> value:
<P>



<PRE>
    threads-&gt;create({'scalar' =&gt; 1}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    my ($thr) = threads-&gt;list();
    my $result = $thr-&gt;join();

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Implicit context</H3>

<A NAME="ixABO"></A>
If not explicitly stated, the thread's context is implied from the context
of the <TT>&quot;-&gt;create()&quot;</TT> call:
<P>



<PRE>
    # Create thread in list context
    my ($thr) = threads-&gt;create(...);

    # Create thread in scalar context
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(...);

    # Create thread in void context
    threads-&gt;create(...);

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>$thr-&gt;<I>wantarray()</I></H3>



<A NAME="ixABP"></A>
This returns the thread's context in the same manner as
<I>wantarray()</I>.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>threads-&gt;<I>wantarray()</I></H3>

<A NAME="ixABQ"></A>
Class method to return the current thread's context.  This returns the same
value as running <I>wantarray()</I> inside the current
thread's entry point function.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THREAD STACK SIZE</H2>

<A NAME="ixABR"></A>
The default per-thread stack size for different platforms varies
significantly, and is almost always far more than is needed for most
applications.  On Win32, Perl's makefile explicitly sets the default stack to
16 <FONT SIZE="-1">MB</FONT>; on most other platforms, the system default is used, which again may be
much larger than is needed.
<P>

By tuning the stack size to more accurately reflect your application's needs,
you may significantly reduce your application's memory usage, and increase the
number of simultaneously running threads.
<P>

Note that on Windows, address space allocation granularity is 64 <FONT SIZE="-1">KB</FONT>,
therefore, setting the stack smaller than that on Win32 Perl will not save any
more memory.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>threads-&gt;<I>get_stack_size()</I>;<DD>
<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
Returns the current default per-thread stack size.  The default is zero, which
means the system default stack size is currently in use.
<DT>$size = $thr-&gt;<I>get_stack_size()</I>;<DD>


<A NAME="ixABT"></A>
Returns the stack size for a particular thread.  A return value of zero
indicates the system default stack size was used for the thread.
<DT>$old_size = threads-&gt;set_stack_size($new_size);<DD>


<A NAME="ixABU"></A>
Sets a new default per-thread stack size, and returns the previous setting.


<P>


Some platforms have a minimum thread stack size.  Trying to set the stack size
below this value will result in a warning, and the minimum stack size will be
used.


<P>


Some Linux platforms have a maximum stack size.  Setting too large of a stack
size will cause thread creation to fail.


<P>


If needed, <TT>$new_size</TT> will be rounded up to the next multiple of the memory
page size (usually 4096 or 8192).


<P>


Threads created after the stack size is set will then either call
<TT>&quot;pthread_attr_setstacksize()&quot;</TT> <I>(for pthreads platforms)</I>, or supply the
stack size to <TT>&quot;CreateThread()&quot;</TT> <I>(for Win32 Perl)</I>.

(Obviously, this call does not affect any currently extant threads.)
<DT>use threads ('stack_size' =&gt; <FONT SIZE="-1">VALUE</FONT>);<DD>
<A NAME="ixABV"></A>
This sets the default per-thread stack size at the start of the application.
<DT>$ENV{'<FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE</FONT>'}<DD>


<A NAME="ixABW"></A>
The default per-thread stack size may be set at the start of the application
through the use of the environment variable <TT>&quot;PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
    PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE=1048576
    export PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE
    perl -e'use threads; print(threads-&gt;get_stack_size(), &quot;\n&quot;)'

</PRE>




<P>


This value overrides any <TT>&quot;stack_size&quot;</TT> parameter given to <TT>&quot;use threads&quot;</TT>.  Its
primary purpose is to permit setting the per-thread stack size for legacy
threaded applications.
<DT>threads-&gt;create({'stack_size' =&gt; <FONT SIZE="-1">VALUE</FONT>}, <FONT SIZE="-1">FUNCTION</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">ARGS</FONT>)<DD>
<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
To specify a particular stack size for any individual thread, call
<TT>&quot;-&gt;create()&quot;</TT> with a hash reference as the first argument:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'stack_size' =&gt; 32*4096}, \&amp;foo, @args);

</PRE>


<DT>$thr2 = $thr1-&gt;create(<FONT SIZE="-1">FUNCTION</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">ARGS</FONT>)<DD>


<A NAME="ixABY"></A>
This creates a new thread (<TT>$thr2</TT>) that inherits the stack size from an
existing thread (<TT>$thr1</TT>).  This is shorthand for the following:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $stack_size = $thr1-&gt;get_stack_size();
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create({'stack_size' =&gt; $stack_size}, FUNCTION, ARGS);

</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THREAD SIGNALLING</H2>

<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
When safe signals is in effect (the default behavior - see ``Unsafe signals''
for more details), then signals may be sent and acted upon by individual
threads.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>$thr-&gt;kill('<FONT SIZE="-1">SIG</FONT>...');<DD>


<A NAME="ixACA"></A>
Sends the specified signal to the thread.  Signal names and (positive) signal
numbers are the same as those supported by
<I>kill()</I>.  For example, '<FONT SIZE="-1">SIGTERM</FONT>', '<FONT SIZE="-1">TERM</FONT>' and
(depending on the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>) 15 are all valid arguments to <TT>&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Returns the thread object to allow for method chaining:


<P>




<PRE>
    $thr-&gt;kill('SIG...')-&gt;join();

</PRE>


</DL>
<P>

Signal handlers need to be set up in the threads for the signals they are
expected to act upon.  Here's an example for <I>cancelling</I> a thread:
<P>



<PRE>
    use threads;

    sub thr_func
    {
        # Thread 'cancellation' signal handler
        $SIG{'KILL'} = sub { threads-&gt;exit(); };

        ...
    }

    # Create a thread
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func');

    ...

    # Signal the thread to terminate, and then detach
    # it so that it will get cleaned up automatically
    $thr-&gt;kill('KILL')-&gt;detach();

</PRE>


<P>

Here's another simplistic example that illustrates the use of thread
signalling in conjunction with a semaphore to provide rudimentary <I>suspend</I>
and <I>resume</I> capabilities:
<P>



<PRE>
    use threads;
    use Thread::Semaphore;

    sub thr_func
    {
        my $sema = shift;

        # Thread 'suspend/resume' signal handler
        $SIG{'STOP'} = sub {
            $sema-&gt;down();      # Thread suspended
            $sema-&gt;up();        # Thread resumes
        };

        ...
    }

    # Create a semaphore and pass it to a thread
    my $sema = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new();
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func', $sema);

    # Suspend the thread
    $sema-&gt;down();
    $thr-&gt;kill('STOP');

    ...

    # Allow the thread to continue
    $sema-&gt;up();

</PRE>


<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">CAVEAT:</FONT>  The thread signalling capability provided by this module does not
actually send signals via the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>.  It <I>emulates</I> signals at the Perl-level
such that signal handlers are called in the appropriate thread.  For example,
sending <TT>&quot;$thr-&gt;kill('STOP')&quot;</TT> does not actually suspend a thread (or the
whole process), but does cause a <TT>$SIG{'STOP'}</TT> handler to be called in that
thread (as illustrated above).
<P>

As such, signals that would normally not be appropriate to use in the
<TT>&quot;kill()&quot;</TT> command (e.g., <TT>&quot;kill('KILL', $$)&quot;</TT>) are okay to use with the
<TT>&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</TT> method (again, as illustrated above).
<P>

Correspondingly, sending a signal to a thread does not disrupt the operation
the thread is currently working on:  The signal will be acted upon after the
current operation has completed.  For instance, if the thread is <I>stuck</I> on
an I/O call, sending it a signal will not cause the I/O call to be interrupted
such that the signal is acted up immediately.
<P>

Sending a signal to a terminated thread is ignored.

<A NAME="ixACI"></A>
The particular copy of Perl that you're trying to use was not built using the
<TT>&quot;useithreads&quot;</TT> configuration option.


<P>


Having threads support requires all of Perl and all of the <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> modules in the
Perl installation to be rebuilt; it is not just a question of adding the
threads module (i.e., threaded and non-threaded Perls are binary
incompatible.)
<DT>Cannot change stack size of an existing thread<DD>
<A NAME="ixACJ"></A>
The stack size of currently extant threads cannot be changed, therefore, the
following results in the above error:


<P>




<PRE>
    $thr-&gt;set_stack_size($size);

</PRE>


<DT>Cannot signal threads without safe signals<DD>

Safe signals must be in effect to use the <TT>&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</TT> signalling method.
See ``Unsafe signals'' for more details.

<H2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
Before you consider posting a bug report, please consult, and possibly post a
message to the discussion forum to see if what you've encountered is a known
problem.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Thread-safe modules<DD>
<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
See ``Making your module threadsafe'' in perlmod when creating modules that may
be used in threaded applications, especially if those modules use non-Perl
data, or <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> code.
<DT>Using non-thread-safe modules<DD>
<A NAME="ixACO"></A>
Unfortunately, you may encounter Perl modules that are not <I>thread-safe</I>.
For example, they may crash the Perl interpreter during execution, or may dump
core on termination.  Depending on the module and the requirements of your
application, it may be possible to work around such difficulties.


<P>


If the module will only be used inside a thread, you can try loading the
module from inside the thread entry point function using <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT> (and
<TT>&quot;import&quot;</TT> if needed):


<P>




<PRE>
    sub thr_func
    {
        require Unsafe::Module
        # Unsafe::Module-&gt;import(...);

        ....
    }

</PRE>




<P>


If the module is needed inside the <I>main</I> thread, try modifying your
application so that the module is loaded (again using <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;-&gt;import()&quot;</TT>) after any threads are started, and in such a way that no
other threads are started afterwards.


<P>


If the above does not work, or is not adequate for your application, then file
a bug report on &lt;<A HREF="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/</A>&gt; against the problematic module.
<DT>Memory consumption<DD>
<A NAME="ixACP"></A>
On most systems, frequent and continual creation and destruction of threads
can lead to ever-increasing growth in the memory footprint of the Perl
interpreter.  While it is simple to just launch threads and then
<TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;-&gt;detach()&quot;</TT> them, for long-lived applications, it is
better to maintain a pool of threads, and to reuse them for the work needed,
using queues to notify threads of pending work.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
distribution of this module contains a simple example
(<I>examples/pool_reuse.pl</I>) illustrating the creation, use and monitoring of a
pool of <I>reusable</I> threads.
<DT>Current working directory<DD>
<A NAME="ixACQ"></A>
On all platforms except MSWin32, the setting for the current working directory
is shared among all threads such that changing it in one thread (e.g., using
<TT>&quot;chdir()&quot;</TT>) will affect all the threads in the application.


<P>


On MSWin32, each thread maintains its own the current working directory
setting.
<DT>Environment variables<DD>
<A NAME="ixACR"></A>
Currently, on all platforms except MSWin32, all <I>system</I> calls (e.g., using
<TT>&quot;system()&quot;</TT> or back-ticks) made from threads use the environment variable
settings from the <I>main</I> thread.  In other words, changes made to <TT>%ENV</TT> in
a thread will not be visible in <I>system</I> calls made by that thread.


<P>


To work around this, set environment variables as part of the <I>system</I> call.
For example:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $msg = 'hello';
    system(&quot;FOO=$msg; echo \$FOO&quot;);   # Outputs 'hello' to STDOUT

</PRE>




<P>


On MSWin32, each thread maintains its own set of environment variables.
<DT>Parent-child threads<DD>
<A NAME="ixACS"></A>
On some platforms, it might not be possible to destroy <I>parent</I> threads while
there are still existing <I>child</I> threads.
<DT>Creating threads inside special blocks<DD>
<A NAME="ixACT"></A>
Creating threads inside <TT>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;CHECK&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;INIT&quot;</TT> blocks should not be
relied upon.  Depending on the Perl version and the application code, results
may range from success, to (apparently harmless) warnings of leaked scalar, or
all the way up to crashing of the Perl interpreter.
<DT>Unsafe signals<DD>
<A NAME="ixACU"></A>
Since Perl 5.8.0, signals have been made safer in Perl by postponing their
handling until the interpreter is in a <I>safe</I> state.  See
``Safe Signals'' in perl58delta and ``Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)'' in perlipc
for more details.


<P>


Safe signals is the default behavior, and the old, immediate, unsafe
signalling behavior is only in effect in the following situations:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Perl has been built with <TT>&quot;PERL_OLD_SIGNALS&quot;</TT> (see <TT>&quot;perl -V&quot;</TT>).
<DT>*<DD>
The environment variable <TT>&quot;PERL_SIGNALS&quot;</TT> is set to <TT>&quot;unsafe&quot;</TT> (see ``<FONT SIZE="-1">PERL_SIGNALS</FONT>'' in perlrun).
<DT>*<DD>
The module Perl::Unsafe::Signals is used.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


If unsafe signals is in effect, then signal handling is not thread-safe, and
the <TT>&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</TT> signalling method cannot be used.
</DL>

<DT>Returning closures from threads<DD>
<A NAME="ixACV"></A>
Returning closures from threads should not be relied upon.  Depending of the
Perl version and the application code, results may range from success, to
(apparently harmless) warnings of leaked scalar, or all the way up to crashing
of the Perl interpreter.
<DT>Returning objects from threads<DD>
<A NAME="ixACW"></A>
Returning objects from threads does not work.  Depending on the classes
involved, you may be able to work around this by returning a serialized
version of the object (e.g., using Data::Dumper or Storable), and then
reconstituting it in the joining thread.  If you're using Perl 5.10.0 or
later, and if the class supports shared objects,
you can pass them via shared queues.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> blocks in threads<DD>
<A NAME="ixACX"></A>
It is possible to add <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> blocks to threads by using require or
eval with the appropriate code.  These <TT>&quot;END&quot;</TT> blocks
will then be executed when the thread's interpreter is destroyed (i.e., either
during a <TT>&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</TT> call, or at program termination).


<P>


However, calling any threads methods in such an <TT>&quot;END&quot;</TT> block will most
likely <I>fail</I> (e.g., the application may hang, or generate an error) due to
mutexes that are needed to control functionality within the threads module.


<P>


For this reason, the use of <TT>&quot;END&quot;</TT> blocks in threads is <B>strongly</B>
discouraged.
<DT>Open directory handles<DD>
<A NAME="ixACY"></A>
In perl 5.14 and higher, on systems other than Windows that do
not support the <TT>&quot;fchdir&quot;</TT> C function, directory handles (see
opendir) will not be copied to new
threads. You can use the <TT>&quot;d_fchdir&quot;</TT> variable in Config.pm to
determine whether your system supports it.


<P>


In prior perl versions, spawning threads with open directory handles would
crash the interpreter.
&lt;[perl #75154]&gt;
<DT>Perl Bugs and the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> Version of threads<DD>
<A NAME="ixACZ"></A>
Support for threads extends beyond the code in this module (i.e.,
<I>threads.pm</I> and <I>threads.xs</I>), and into the Perl interpreter itself.  Older
versions of Perl contain bugs that may manifest themselves despite using the
latest version of threads from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.  There is no workaround for this other
than upgrading to the latest version of Perl.


<P>


Even with the latest version of Perl, it is known that certain constructs
with threads may result in warning messages concerning leaked scalars or
unreferenced scalars.  However, such warnings are harmless, and may safely be
ignored.


<P>
