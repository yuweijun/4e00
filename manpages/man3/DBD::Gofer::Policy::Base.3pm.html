<H2>NAME</H2>

DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base - Base class for DBD::Gofer policies
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>


<PRE>
  $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=...&quot;, ...)

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
DBD::Gofer can be configured via a 'policy' mechanism that allows you to
fine-tune the number of round-trips to the Gofer server.  The policies are
grouped into classes (which may be subclassed) and referenced by the name of
the class.
<P>

The DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base class is the base class for all the policy
classes and describes all the individual policy items.
<P>

The Base policy is not used directly. You should use a policy class derived from it.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POLICY CLASSES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Three policy classes are supplied with DBD::Gofer:
<P>

DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic is most 'transparent' but slowest because it
makes more  round-trips to the Gofer server.
<P>

DBD::Gofer::Policy::classic is a reasonable compromise - it's the default policy.
<P>

DBD::Gofer::Policy::rush is fastest, but may require code changes in your applications.
<P>

Generally the default <TT>&quot;classic&quot;</TT> policy is fine. When first testing an existing
application with Gofer it is a good idea to start with the <TT>&quot;pedantic&quot;</TT> policy
first and then switch to <TT>&quot;classic&quot;</TT> or a custom policy, for final testing.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POLICY ITEMS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
These are temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their defaults.
<P>

In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in the pod and parsed out at load-time.
<P>

See the source code to this module for more details.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POLICY CUSTOMIZATION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">XXX</FONT> This area of DBD::Gofer is subject to change.
<P>

There are three ways to customize policies:
<P>

Policy classes are designed to influence the overall behaviour of DBD::Gofer
with existing, unaltered programs, so they work in a reasonably optimal way
without requiring code changes. You can implement new policy classes as
subclasses of existing policies.
<P>

In many cases individual policy items can be overridden on a case-by-case basis
within your application code. You do this by passing a corresponding
<TT>&quot;&lt;go_&lt;policy_name&quot;</TT>&gt;&gt; attribute into <FONT SIZE="-1">DBI</FONT> methods by your application code.
This let's you fine-tune the behaviour for special cases.
<P>

The policy items are implemented as methods. In many cases the methods are
passed parameters relating to the DBD::Gofer code being executed. This means
the policy can implement dynamic behaviour that varies depending on the
particular circumstances, such as the particular statement being executed.
