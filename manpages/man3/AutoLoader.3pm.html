AutoLoader - load subroutines only on demand
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>


<PRE>
    package Foo;
    use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';   # import the default AUTOLOAD subroutine

    package Bar;
    use AutoLoader;              # don't import AUTOLOAD, define our own
    sub AUTOLOAD {
        ...
        $AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD = &quot;...&quot;;
        goto &amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD;
    }

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The <B>AutoLoader</B> module works with the <B>AutoSplit</B> module and the
<TT>&quot;__END__&quot;</TT> token to defer the loading of some subroutines until they are
used rather than loading them all at once.
<P>

To use <B>AutoLoader</B>, the author of a module has to place the
definitions of subroutines to be autoloaded after an <TT>&quot;__END__&quot;</TT> token.
(See perldata.)  The <B>AutoSplit</B> module can then be run manually to
extract the definitions into individual files <I>auto/funcname.al</I>.
<P>

<B>AutoLoader</B> implements an <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine.  When an undefined
subroutine in is called in a client module of <B>AutoLoader</B>,
<B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine attempts to locate the subroutine in a
file with a name related to the location of the file from which the
client module was read.  As an example, if <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>POSIX</I></FONT><I>.pm</I> is located in
<I>/usr/local/lib/perl5/POSIX.pm</I>, <B>AutoLoader</B> will look for perl
subroutines <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>POSIX</B></FONT><B></B> in <I>/usr/local/lib/perl5/auto/POSIX/*.al</I>, where
the <TT>&quot;.al&quot;</TT> file has the same name as the subroutine, sans package.  If
such a file exists, <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> will read and evaluate it,
thus (presumably) defining the needed subroutine.  <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> will then
<TT>&quot;goto&quot;</TT> the newly defined subroutine.
<P>

Once this process completes for a given function, it is defined, so
future calls to the subroutine will bypass the <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> mechanism.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Subroutine Stubs</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
In order for object method lookup and/or prototype checking to operate
correctly even when methods have not yet been defined it is necessary to
``forward declare'' each subroutine (as in <TT>&quot;sub NAME;&quot;</TT>).  See
``<FONT SIZE="-1">SYNOPSIS</FONT>'' in perlsub.  Such forward declaration creates ``subroutine
stubs'', which are place holders with no code.
<P>

The AutoSplit and <B>AutoLoader</B> modules automate the creation of forward
declarations.  The AutoSplit module creates an 'index' file containing
forward declarations of all the AutoSplit subroutines.  When the
AutoLoader module is 'use'd it loads these declarations into its callers
package.
<P>

Because of this mechanism it is important that <B>AutoLoader</B> is always
<TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT>d and not <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT>d.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Using <B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> Subroutine</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
In order to use <B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine you <I>must</I>
explicitly import it:
<P>



<PRE>
    use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overriding <B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> Subroutine</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Some modules, mainly extensions, provide their own <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutines.
They typically need to check for some special cases (such as constants)
and then fallback to <B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> for the rest.
<P>

Such modules should <I>not</I> import <B>AutoLoader</B>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine.
Instead, they should define their own <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutines along these
lines:
<P>



<PRE>
    use AutoLoader;
    use Carp;

    sub AUTOLOAD {
        my $sub = $AUTOLOAD;
        (my $constname = $sub) =~ s/.*:://;
        my $val = constant($constname, @_ ? $_[0] : 0);
        if ($! != 0) {
            if ($! =~ /Invalid/ || $!{EINVAL}) {
                $AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD = $sub;
                goto &amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD;
            }
            else {
                croak &quot;Your vendor has not defined constant $constname&quot;;
            }
        }
        *$sub = sub { $val }; # same as: eval &quot;sub $sub { $val }&quot;;
        goto &amp;$sub;
    }

</PRE>


<P>

If any module's own <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine has no need to fallback to the
AutoLoader's <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutine (because it doesn't have any AutoSplit
subroutines), then that module should not use <B>AutoLoader</B> at all.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Package Lexicals</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Package lexicals declared with <TT>&quot;my&quot;</TT> in the main block of a package
using <B>AutoLoader</B> will not be visible to auto-loaded subroutines, due to
the fact that the given scope ends at the <TT>&quot;__END__&quot;</TT> marker.  A module
using such variables as package globals will not work properly under the
<B>AutoLoader</B>.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;vars&quot;</TT> pragma (see ``vars'' in perlmod) may be used in such
situations as an alternative to explicitly qualifying all globals with
the package namespace.  Variables pre-declared with this pragma will be
visible to any autoloaded routines (but will not be invisible outside
the package, unfortunately).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Not Using AutoLoader</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
You can stop using AutoLoader by simply
<P>



<PRE>
        no AutoLoader;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><B>AutoLoader</B> vs. <B>SelfLoader</B></H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
The <B>AutoLoader</B> is similar in purpose to <B>SelfLoader</B>: both delay the
loading of subroutines.
<P>

<B>SelfLoader</B> uses the <TT>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</TT> marker rather than <TT>&quot;__END__&quot;</TT>.
While this avoids the use of a hierarchy of disk files and the
associated open/close for each routine loaded, <B>SelfLoader</B> suffers a
startup speed disadvantage in the one-time parsing of the lines after
<TT>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</TT>, after which routines are cached.  <B>SelfLoader</B> can also
handle multiple packages in a file.
<P>

<B>AutoLoader</B> only reads code as it is requested, and in many cases
should be faster, but requires a mechanism like <B>AutoSplit</B> be used to
create the individual files.  ExtUtils::MakeMaker will invoke
<B>AutoSplit</B> automatically if <B>AutoLoader</B> is used in a module source
file.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
AutoLoaders prior to Perl 5.002 had a slightly different interface.  Any
old modules which use <B>AutoLoader</B> should be changed to the new calling
style.  Typically this just means changing a require to a use, adding
the explicit <TT>'AUTOLOAD'</TT> import if needed, and removing <B>AutoLoader</B>
from <TT>@ISA</TT>.
<P>

On systems with restrictions on file name length, the file corresponding
to a subroutine may have a shorter name that the routine itself.  This
can lead to conflicting file names.  The <I>AutoSplit</I> package warns of
these potential conflicts when used to split a module.
<P>

AutoLoader may fail to find the autosplit files (or even find the wrong
ones) in cases where <TT>@INC</TT> contains relative paths, <B>and</B> the program
does <TT>&quot;chdir&quot;</TT>.

    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
