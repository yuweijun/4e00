<P>
<B>int shmctl(int </B><I>shmid</I><B>, int </B><I>cmd</I><B>, struct shmid_ds *</B><I>buf</I><B>);</B>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>shmctl</B>()

performs the control operation specified by
<I>cmd</I>

on the shared memory segment whose identifier is given in
<I>shmid</I>.

<P>

The
<I>buf</I>

argument is a pointer to a <I>shmid_ds</I> structure,
defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/sys/shm.h">sys/shm.h</A>&gt;</I> as follows:
<P>


<PRE>
struct shmid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm shm_perm;    /* Ownership and permissions */
    size_t          shm_segsz;   /* Size of segment (bytes) */
    time_t          shm_atime;   /* Last attach time */
    time_t          shm_dtime;   /* Last detach time */
    time_t          shm_ctime;   /* Last change time */
    pid_t           shm_cpid;    /* PID of creator */
    pid_t           shm_lpid;    /* PID of last <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+shmat">shmat</A>(2)/<A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+shmdt">shmdt</A>(2) */
    shmatt_t        shm_nattch;  /* No. of current attaches */
    ...
};
</PRE>


<P>

The
<I>ipc_perm</I>

structure is defined in <I>&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/sys/ipc.h">sys/ipc.h</A>&gt;</I> as follows
(the highlighted fields are settable using
<B>IPC_SET</B>):

<P>


<PRE>
struct ipc_perm {
    key_t          __key;    /* Key supplied to <A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+shmget">shmget</A>(2) */
    uid_t          <B>uid</B>;      /* Effective UID of owner */
    gid_t          <B>gid</B>;      /* Effective GID of owner */
    uid_t          cuid;     /* Effective UID of creator */
    gid_t          cgid;     /* Effective GID of creator */
    unsigned short <B>mode</B>;     /* <B>Permissions</B> + SHM_DEST and
                                SHM_LOCKED flags */
    unsigned short __seq;    /* Sequence number */
};
</PRE>


<P>

Valid values for
<I>cmd</I>

are:
<BR>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IPC_STAT</B>

<DD>
Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with
<I>shmid</I>

into the
<I>shmid_ds</I>

structure pointed to by <I>buf</I>.
The caller must have read permission on the
shared memory segment.
<DT><B>IPC_SET</B>

<DD>
Write the values of some members of the
<I>shmid_ds</I>

structure pointed to by
<I>buf</I>

to the kernel data structure associated with this shared memory segment,
updating also its
<I>shm_ctime</I>

member.
The following fields can be changed:
<I>shm_perm.uid</I>, <I>shm_perm.gid</I>,
and (the least significant 9 bits of) <I>shm_perm.mode</I>.
The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner
(<I>shm_perm.uid</I>)

or creator
(<I>shm_perm.cuid</I>)

of the shared memory segment, or the caller must be privileged.
<DT><B>IPC_RMID</B>

<DD>
Mark the segment to be destroyed.
The segment will only actually be destroyed
after the last process detaches it (i.e., when the
<I>shm_nattch</I>

member of the associated structure
<I>shmid_ds</I>

is zero).
The caller must be the owner or creator, or be privileged.
If a segment has been marked for destruction, then the (non-standard)
<B>SHM_DEST</B>

flag of the
<I>shm_perm.mode</I>

field in the associated data structure retrieved by
<B>IPC_STAT</B>

will be set.
</DL>
<P>

The caller <I>must</I> ensure that a segment is eventually destroyed;
otherwise its pages that were faulted in will remain in memory or swap.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IPC_INFO</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Returns information about system-wide shared memory limits and
parameters in the structure pointed to by
<I>buf</I>.

This structure is of type
<I>shminfo</I>

(thus, a cast is required),
defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/sys/shm.h">sys/shm.h</A>&gt;</I>

if the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro is defined:
<PRE>

struct  shminfo {
    unsigned long shmmax; /* Maximum segment size */
    unsigned long shmmin; /* Minimum segment size;
                             always 1 */
    unsigned long shmmni; /* Maximum number of segments */
    unsigned long shmseg; /* Maximum number of segments
                             that a process can attach;
                             unused within kernel */
    unsigned long shmall; /* Maximum number of pages of
                             shared memory, system-wide */
};

</PRE>

The
<I>shmmni</I>,

<I>shmmax</I>,

and
<I>shmall</I>

settings can be changed via
<I>/proc</I>

files of the same name; see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+proc">proc</A></B>(5)

for details.
<DT><B>SHM_INFO</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Returns a
<I>shm_info</I>

structure whose fields contain information
about system resources consumed by shared memory.
This structure is defined in
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/sys/shm.h">sys/shm.h</A>&gt;</I>

if the
<B>_GNU_SOURCE</B>

feature test macro is defined:
<PRE>

struct shm_info {
    int           used_ids; /* # of currently existing
                               segments */
    unsigned long shm_tot;  /* Total number of shared
                               memory pages */
    unsigned long shm_rss;  /* # of resident shared
                               memory pages */
    unsigned long shm_swp;  /* # of swapped shared
                               memory pages */
    unsigned long swap_attempts;
                            /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
    unsigned long swap_successes;
                            /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
};
</PRE>

<DT><B>SHM_STAT</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Returns a
<I>shmid_ds</I>

structure as for
<B>IPC_STAT</B>.

However, the
<I>shmid</I>

argument is not a segment identifier, but instead an index into
the kernel's internal array that maintains information about
all shared memory segments on the system.
</DL>
<P>

The caller can prevent or allow swapping of a shared
memory segment with the following <I>cmd</I> values:
<BR>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SHM_LOCK</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Prevent swapping of the shared memory segment.
The caller must fault in
any pages that are required to be present after locking is enabled.
If a segment has been locked, then the (non-standard)
<B>SHM_LOCKED</B>

flag of the
<I>shm_perm.mode</I>

field in the associated data structure retrieved by
<B>IPC_STAT</B>

will be set.
<DT><B>SHM_UNLOCK</B> (Linux-specific)

<DD>
Unlock the segment, allowing it to be swapped out.
</DL>
<P>

In kernels before 2.6.10, only a privileged process
could employ
<B>SHM_LOCK</B>

and
<B>SHM_UNLOCK</B>.

Since kernel 2.6.10, an unprivileged process can employ these operations
if its effective UID matches the owner or creator UID of the segment, and
(for
<B>SHM_LOCK</B>)

the amount of memory to be locked falls within the
<B>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</B>

resource limit (see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+setrlimit">setrlimit</A></B>(2)).





<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

A successful
<B>IPC_INFO</B>

or
<B>SHM_INFO</B>

operation returns the index of the highest used entry in the
kernel's internal array recording information about all
shared memory segments.
(This information can be used with repeated
<B>SHM_STAT</B>

operations to obtain information about all shared memory segments
on the system.)
A successful
<B>SHM_STAT</B>

operation returns the identifier of the shared memory segment
whose index was given in
<I>shmid</I>.

Other operations return 0 on success.
<P>
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EACCES</B>

<DD>
<B>IPC_STAT</B> or <B>SHM_STAT</B> is requested and
<I>shm_perm.mode</I> does not allow read access for
<I>shmid</I>,

and the calling process does not have the
<B>CAP_IPC_OWNER</B>

capability.
<DT><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
The argument
<I>cmd</I>

has value
<B>IPC_SET</B>

or
<B>IPC_STAT</B>

but the address pointed to by
<I>buf</I>

isn't accessible.
<DT><B>EIDRM</B>

<DD>
<I>shmid</I> points to a removed identifier.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
<I>shmid</I> is not a valid identifier, or <I>cmd</I>
is not a valid command.
Or: for a
<B>SHM_STAT</B>

operation, the index value specified in
<I>shmid</I>

referred to an array slot that is currently unused.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
(In kernels since 2.6.9),
<B>SHM_LOCK</B>

was specified and the size of the to-be-locked segment would mean
that the total bytes in locked shared memory segments would exceed
the limit for the real user ID of the calling process.
This limit is defined by the
<B>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</B>

soft resource limit (see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+setrlimit">setrlimit</A></B>(2)).

<DT><B>EOVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
<B>IPC_STAT</B> is attempted, and the GID or UID value
is too large to be stored in the structure pointed to by
<I>buf</I>.

<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
<B>IPC_SET</B> or <B>IPC_RMID</B> is attempted, and the
effective user ID of the calling process is not that of the creator
(found in
<I>shm_perm.cuid</I>),

or the owner
(found in
<I>shm_perm.uid</I>),

and the process was not privileged (Linux: did not have the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability).
<P>
Or (in kernels before 2.6.9),
<B>SHM_LOCK</B>

or
<B>SHM_UNLOCK</B>

was specified, but the process was not privileged
(Linux: did not have the
<B>CAP_IPC_LOCK</B>

capability).
(Since Linux 2.6.9, this error can also occur if the
<B>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</B>

is 0 and the caller is not privileged.)

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The
<B>IPC_INFO</B>,

<B>SHM_STAT</B>

and
<B>SHM_INFO</B>

operations are used by the
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?8+ipcs">ipcs</A></B>(8)

program to provide information on allocated resources.
In the future these may modified or moved to a /proc file system
interface.
<P>
Linux permits a process to attach
(<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?2+shmat">shmat</A></B>(2))

a shared memory segment that has already been marked for deletion
using
<I>shmctl(IPC_RMID)</I>.

This feature is not available on other Unix implementations;
portable applications should avoid relying on it.
<P>
Various fields in a <I>struct shmid_ds</I> were typed as
<I>short</I>

under Linux 2.2
and have become
<I>long</I>

under Linux 2.4.
To take advantage of this,
a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should suffice.
(The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an
<B>IPC_64</B>

flag in
<I>cmd</I>.)
