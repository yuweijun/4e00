<h1>Definite Assignment</h1>
<hr><p>
<a name="68435"></a>
Each local variable <a href="statements.doc.html#5920">(&#167;14.4)</a> and every blank <code>final</code> <a href="typesValues.doc.html#10931">(&#167;4.5.4)</a> field <a href="classes.doc.html#35962">(&#167;8.3.1.2)</a> must have a <em>definitely assigned</em> value when any access of its value occurs. A Java compiler must carry out a specific conservative flow analysis to make sure that, for every access of a local variable or blank <code>final</code> field f, f is definitely assigned before the access; otherwise a compile-time error must occur.<p>
<a name="53690"></a>
Similarly, every blank <code>final</code> variable must be assigned at most once; it must be <em>definitely unassigned</em> when an assignment to it occurs. A Java compiler must carry out a specific conservative flow analysis to make sure that, for every assignment to a blank <code>final</code> variable, the variable is definitely unassigned before the assignment; otherwise a compile-time error must occur.<p>
<a name="29500"></a>
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a precise explanation of the words "definitely assigned before" and "definitely unassigned before".<p>
<a name="53741"></a>
The idea behind definite assignment is that an assignment to the local variable or blank <code>final</code> field must occur on every possible execution path to the access. Similarly, the idea behind definite unassignment is that no other assignment to the blank <code>final</code> variable is permitted to occur on any possible execution path to an assignment. The analysis takes into account the structure of statements and expressions; it also provides a special treatment of the expression operators <code>!</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>?&#32;:</code>, and of boolean-valued constant expressions.<p>
<a name="53744"></a>
For example, a Java compiler recognizes that <code>k</code> is definitely assigned before its access (as an argument of a method invocation) in the code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>{
	int k;
	if (v &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (k = System.in.read()) &gt;= 0)
		System.out.println(k);
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="25994"></a>
because the access occurs only if the value of the expression:<p>
<blockquote><pre>v &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (k = System.in.read()) &gt;= 0
</pre></blockquote><a name="25996"></a>
is true, and the value can be <code>true</code> only if the assignment to <code>k</code> is executed (more properly, evaluated).<p>
<a name="54962"></a>
Similarly, a Java compiler will recognize that in the code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>{
	int k;
	while (true) {
		k = n;
		if (k &gt;= 5) break;
		n = 6;
	}
	System.out.println(k);
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="26006"></a>
the variable <code>k</code> is definitely assigned by the <code>while</code> statement because the condition expression <code>true</code> never has the value <code>false</code>, so only the <code>break</code> statement can cause the <code>while</code> statement to complete normally, and <code>k</code> is definitely assigned before the <code>break</code> statement.<p>
<a name="54966"></a>
On the other hand, the code<p>
<blockquote><pre>{
	int k;
	while (n &lt; 4) {
		k = n;
		if (k &gt;= 5) break;
		n = 6;
	}
	System.out.println(k);	// k is not "definitely assigned" before this
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="54931"></a>
must be rejected by a Java compiler, because in this case the <code>while</code> statement is not guaranteed to execute its body as far as the rules of definite assignment are concerned.<p>
<a name="26007"></a>
Except for the special treatment of the conditional boolean operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and<code> ? : </code>and of boolean-valued constant expressions, the values of expressions are not taken into account in the flow analysis. <p>
<a name="63512"></a>
For example, a Java compiler must produce a compile-time error for the code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>{
	int k;
	int n = 5;
	if (n &gt; 2)
		k = 3;
	System.out.println(k);	// k is not "definitely assigned" before this
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="26015"></a>
even though the value of <code>n</code> is known at compile time, and in principle it can be known at compile time that the assignment to <code>k</code> will always be executed (more properly, evaluated). A Java compiler must operate according to the rules laid out in this section. The rules recognize only constant expressions; in this example, the expression <code>n</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>2</code> is not a constant expression as defined in <a href="expressions.doc.html#5313">&#167;15.28</a>. <p>
<a name="26019"></a>
As another example, a Java compiler will accept the code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>void flow(boolean flag) {
	int k;
	if (flag)
		k = 3;
	else
		k = 4;
	System.out.println(k);
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="26028"></a>
as far as definite assignment of <code>k</code> is concerned, because the rules outlined in this section allow it to tell that <code>k</code> is assigned no matter whether the flag is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. But the rules do not accept the variation:<p>
<blockquote><pre>void flow(boolean flag) {
	int k;
	if (flag)
		k = 3;
	if (!flag)
		k = 4;
	System.out.println(k);	// k is not "definitely assigned" before here
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="26037"></a>
and so compiling this program must cause a compile-time error to occur.<p>
<a name="54848"></a>
A related example illustrates rules of definite unassignment. A Java compiler will accept the code:<p>
<blockquote><pre>void unflow(boolean flag) {
	final int k;
	if (flag) {
		k = 3;
		System.out.println(k);
	}
	else {
		k = 4;
		System.out.println(k);
	}
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="54859"></a>
as far as definite unassignment of <code>k</code> is concerned, because the rules outlined in this section allow it to tell that <code>k</code> is assigned at most once (indeed, exactly once) no matter whether the flag is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. But the rules do not accept the variation:<p>
<blockquote><pre>void unflow(boolean flag) {
	final int k;
	if (flag) {
		k = 3;
		System.out.println(k);
	}
	if (!flag) {
		k = 4; 		// k is not "definitely unassigned" before here
		System.out.println(k);
	}
}
</pre></blockquote><a name="54923"></a>
and so compiling this program must cause a compile-time error to occur.<p>
<a name="26038"></a>
In order to precisely specify all the cases of definite assignment, the rules in this section define several technical terms:<p>
<ul><a name="26039"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely assigned before</em> a statement or expression;
<a name="53753"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely unassigned before</em> a statement or expression;
<a name="53772"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely assigned after </em>a statement or expression; and
<a name="53754"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely unassigned after </em>a statement or expression.
</ul><a name="26041"></a>
For boolean-valued expressions, the last two are refined into four cases:<p>
<ul><a name="53786"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely assigned after</em> the expression <em>when true</em>;
<a name="53790"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely unassigned after</em> the expression <em>when true</em>;
<a name="53794"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely assigned after</em> the expression <em>when false</em>; and
<a name="53798"></a>
<li>whether a variable is <em>definitely unassigned after</em> the expression <em>when false</em>.
</ul><a name="26044"></a>
Here <em>when true</em> and <em>when false</em> refer to the value of the expression. <p>
<a name="63514"></a>
For example, the local variable k is definitely assigned a value after evaluation of the expression<p>
<blockquote><pre>a &amp;&amp; ((k=m) &gt; 5)
</pre></blockquote><a name="26046"></a>
when the expression is <code>true</code> but not when the expression is <code>false</code> (because if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code>, then the assignment to <code>k</code> is not necessarily executed (more properly, evaluated)).<p>
<a name="26047"></a>
The phrase "V is definitely assigned after X" (where V is a local variable and X is a statement or expression) means "V is definitely assigned after X if X completes normally". If X completes abruptly, the assignment need not have occurred, and the rules stated here take this into account. A peculiar consequence of this definition is that "V is definitely assigned after <code>break;</code>" is always true! Because a <code>break</code> statement never completes normally, it is vacuously true that V has been assigned a value if the <code>break</code> statement completes normally.<p>
<a name="53802"></a>
Similarly, the statement "V is definitely unassigned after X" (where V is a variable and X is a statement or expression) means "V is definitely unassigned after X if X completes normally". An even more peculiar consequence of this definition is that "V is definitely unassigned after <code>break;</code>" is always true! Because a <code>break</code> statement never completes normally, it is vacuously true that V has not been assigned a value if the <code>break</code> statement completes normally. (For that matter, it is also vacuously true that the moon is made of green cheese if the <code>break</code> statement completes normally.)<p>
<a name="54969"></a>
In all, there are four possibilities for a variable V after a statement or expression has been executed:<p>
<ul><a name="54980"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned and is not definitely unassigned.(The flow analysis rules prove that an assignment to V has occurred.)
<a name="54984"></a>
<li>V is definitely unassigned and is not definitely assigned.(The flow analysis rules prove that an assignment to V has not occurred.)
<a name="54988"></a>
<li>V is not definitely assigned and is not definitely unassigned.(The rules cannot prove whether or not an assignment to V has occurred.)
<a name="54992"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned and is definitely unassigned.(It is impossible for the statement or expression to complete normally.)
</ul><a name="26048"></a>
To shorten the rules, the customary abbreviation "iff" is used to mean "if and only if". We also use an abbreviation convention: if a rule contains one or more occurrences of "[un]assigned" then it stands for two rules, one with every occurrence of "[un]assigned" replaced by "definitely assigned" and one with every occurrence of "[un]assigned" replaced by "definitely unassigned". <p>
<a name="63513"></a>
For example:<p>
<a name="53830"></a>
V is [un]assigned after an empty statement iff it is [un]assigned before the empty statement.<p>
<a name="53835"></a>
should be understood to stand for two rules:<p>
<ul><a name="53840"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned after an empty statement iff it is definitely assigned before the empty statement.
<a name="53851"></a>
<li>V is definitely unassigned after an empty statement iff it is definitely unassigned before the empty statement.
<a name="58384"></a>
</ul>
<p>
The definite unassignment analysis of loop statements raises a special problem. Consider the statement <code>while</code> <code>(</code>e<code>)</code> S. In order to determine whether V is definitely unassigned within some subexpression of <em>e</em>, we need to determine whether V is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em>. One might argue, by analogy with the rule for definite assignment <a href="defAssign.doc.html#44047">(&#167;16.2.9)</a>, that V is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em> iff it is definitely unassigned before the <code>while</code> statement. However, such a rule is inadequate for our purposes. If <em>e</em> evaluates to true, the statement S will be executed. Later, if V is assigned by S, then in the following iteration(s) V will have already been assigned when <em>e</em> is evaluated. Under the rule suggested above, it would be possible to assign V multiple times, which is exactly what we have sought to avoid by introducing these rules.<p>
<a name="58385"></a>
A revised rule would be: "V is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em> iff it is definitely unassigned before the while statement and definitely unassigned after S". However, when we formulate the rule for S, we find: "V is definitely unassigned before S iff it is definitely unassigned after <em>e</em> when true". This leads to a circularity. In effect, V is definitely unassigned <em>before</em> the loop condition <em>e </em>only if it is unassigned <em>after</em> the loop as a whole! <p>
<a name="58386"></a>
We break this vicious circle using a <em>hypothetical</em> analysis of the loop condition and body. For example, if we assume that V is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em> (regardless of whether V really is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em>), and can then prove that V was definitely unassigned after <em>e</em> then we know that <em>e</em> does not assign V. This is stated more formally as:<p>
<a name="58387"></a>
Assuming V is definitely unassigned before <em>e</em>, V is definitely unassigned after <em>e</em>.<p>
<a name="58388"></a>
Variations on the above analysis are used to define well founded definite unassignment rules for all loop statements in the language.<p>
</ul><a name="58087"></a>
Throughout the rest of this chapter, we will, unless explicitly stated otherwise, write V to represent a local variable or a blank <code>final</code> field (for rules of definite assignment) or a blank <code>final</code> variable (for rules of definite unassignment). Likewise, we will use <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>e </em>to represent expressions, and S and T to represent statements.<p>

<h2>16.1    Definite Assignment and Expressions</h2>
<a name="55164"></a>
<h3>16.1.1    Boolean Constant Expressions</h3>
<ul><a name="55507"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after any constant expression whose value is <code>true</code> when false.
<a name="55154"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after any constant expression whose value is <code>false</code> when true.
</ul><a name="55559"></a>
Because a constant expression whose value is <code>true</code> never has the value <code>false</code>, and a constant expression whose value is <code>false</code> never has the value <code>true</code>, the two preceding rules are vacuously satisfied. They are helpful in analyzing expressions involving the operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <a href="defAssign.doc.html#29521">(&#167;16.1.2)</a>, <code>||</code> <a href="defAssign.doc.html#26067">(&#167;16.1.3)</a>, <code>!</code> <a href="defAssign.doc.html#54187">(&#167;16.1.4)</a>, and <code>?</code> <code>:</code> <a href="defAssign.doc.html#26118">(&#167;16.1.5)</a>.<p>
<ul><a name="55552"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after any constant expression whose value is <code>true</code> when true iff V is [un]assigned before the constant expression.
<a name="55511"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after any constant expression whose value is <code>false</code> when false iff V is [un]assigned before the constant expression.
<a name="26054"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after a boolean-valued constant expression <em>e</em> iff V is [un]assigned after <em>e</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>e</em> when false. (This is equivalent to saying that V is [un]assigned after <em>e</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <em>e</em>.)
</ul><a name="29521"></a>
<h3>16.1.2    The Boolean Operator &amp;&amp;</h3>
<ul><a name="26063"></a>

<a name="55175"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em> when false iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when false and V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> when false.
<a name="55176"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em>.
<a name="55177"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>b </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when true.
<a name="55080"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em> iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em> when false.
</ul><a name="26067"></a>
<h3>16.1.3    The Boolean Operator ||</h3>
<ul><a name="26068"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em> when true iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> when true.
<a name="26069"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em> when false iff V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> when false.
<a name="26070"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em>.
<a name="26071"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>b </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when false.
<a name="55084"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em> iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em> when false.
</ul><a name="54187"></a>
<h3>16.1.4    The Boolean Operator !</h3>
<ul><a name="54188"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a when true iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when false.
<a name="26074"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a when false iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when true.
<a name="26075"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <code>!</code>a.
<a name="55092"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a iff V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a when true and V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a when false. (This is equivalent to saying that V is [un]assigned after <code>!</code>a iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em>.)
</ul><a name="26118"></a>
<h3>16.1.5    The Boolean Operator ?&#32;:</h3>
<a name="54079"></a>
Suppose that <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> are boolean-valued expressions.<p>
<ul><a name="54080"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c </em>when true iff V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>c</em> when true.
<a name="26123"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c </em>when false iff V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> when false and V is [un]assigned after <em>c</em> when false.
<a name="26126"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em>.
<a name="26127"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>b </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when true.
<a name="26128"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>c </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when false.
<a name="55096"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em> iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em> when true and V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em> when false.
</ul><a name="26129"></a>
<h3>16.1.6    The Conditional Operator ?&#32;:</h3>
<a name="26130"></a>
Suppose that <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> are expressions that are not boolean-valued.<p>
<ul><a name="26131"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>b</em> and V is [un]assigned after <em>c.</em>
<a name="26134"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em>.
<a name="26135"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>b </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when true.
<a name="26136"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>c </em>iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em> when false.
</ul><a name="26150"></a>
<h3>16.1.7    Assignment Expressions</h3>
<a name="26151"></a>
Consider an assignment expression <em>a</em> <code>=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>+=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>-=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>*=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>/=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>%=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>&lt;&lt;=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>&amp;=</code> <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> <code>|=</code> <em>b</em>, or <em>a</em> <code>^=</code> <em>b</em>.<p>
<ul><a name="26152"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned after the assignment expression iff either <em>a</em> is V or V is definitely assigned after <em>b</em>.
<a name="54335"></a>
<li>V is definitely unassigned after the assignment expression iff <em>a</em> is not V and V is definitely unassigned after <em>b</em>.
<a name="54321"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before the assignment expression.
<a name="54322"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>b</em> iff V is [un]assigned after <em>a</em>.
<a name="58763"></a>
Note that if <em>a</em> is V and V is not definitely assigned before a compound assignment such as <em>a</em> <code>&amp;=</code> <em>b</em>, then a compile-time error will necessarily occur. The first rule for definite assignment stated above includes the disjunct "<em>a</em> is V" even for compound assignment expressions, not just simple assignments, so that V will be considered to have been definitely assigned at later points in the code. Including the disjunct "<em>a</em> is V" does not affect the binary decision as to whether a program is acceptable or will result in a compile-time error, but it affects <em>how many</em> different points in the code may be regarded as erroneous, and so in practice it can improve the quality of error reporting. A similar remark applies to the inclusion of the conjunct "<em>a</em> is not V" in the first rule for definite unassignment stated above.<p>
</ul><a name="55712"></a>
If the assignment expression is boolean-valued, then these rules also apply:<p>
<ul><a name="55715"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after the assignment expression when true iff V is [un]assigned after the assignment expression.
<a name="55727"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned after the assignment expression when false iff V is [un]assigned after the assignment expression.
</ul><a name="54323"></a>
<h3>16.1.8    Operators ++ and --</h3>
<ul><a name="26156"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned after <code>++</code>a, <code>--</code>a, <em>a</em><code>++</code>, or <em>a</em><code>--</code> iff either <em>a</em> is V or V is definitely assigned after the operand expression.
<a name="55698"></a>
<li>V is definitely unassigned after <code>++</code>a, <code>--</code>a, <em>a</em><code>++</code>, or <em>a</em><code>--</code> iff <em>a</em> is not V and V is definitely unassigned after the operand expression.
<a name="55699"></a>
<li>V is [un]assigned before <em>a</em> iff V is [un]assigned before <code>++</code>a, <code>--</code>a, <em>a</em><code>++</code>, or <em>a</em><code>--</code>. 
</ul><a name="26158"></a>
<h3>16.1.9    Other Expressions</h3>
<a name="26159"></a>
If an expression is not a boolean constant expression, and is not a preincrement expression <code>++</code>a, predecrement expression <code>--</code>a, postincrement expression <em>a</em><code>++</code>, postdecrement expression <em>a</em><code>--</code>, logical complement expression <code>!</code>a, conditional-and expression <em>a</em> &#32;<code>&amp;&amp;</code> <em>b</em>, conditional-or expression <em>a</em> <code>||</code> <em>b</em>, conditional expression <em>a</em> <code>?</code> <em>b</em> <code>:</code> <em>c</em>, or assignment expression, then the following rules apply:<p>
<ul><a name="26160"></a>
<li>If the expression has no subexpressions, V is [un]assigned after the expression iff V is [un]assigned before the expression. This case applies to literals, names, <code>this</code> (both qualified and unqualified), unqualified class instance creation expressions with no arguments, initialized array creation expressions whose initializers contain no expressions, unqualified superclass field access expressions, named method invocations with no arguments, and unqualified superclass method invocations with no arguments.
<a name="26161"></a>
<li>If the expression has subexpressions, V is [un]assigned after the expression iff V is [un]assigned after its rightmost immediate subexpression.
</ul><a name="26162"></a>
There is a piece of subtle reasoning behind the assertion that a variable V can be known to be definitely unassigned after a method invocation. Taken by itself, at face value and without qualification, such an assertion is not always true, because an invoked method can perform assignments. But it must be remembered that, for the purposes of the Java programming language, the concept of definite unassignment is applied <em>only</em> to blank <code>final</code> variables. If V is a blank <code>final</code> local variable, then only the method to which its declaration belongs can perform assignments to V. If V is a blank <code>final</code> field, then only a constructor or an initializer for the class containing the declaration for V can perform assignments to V; no method can perform assignments to V. Finally, explicit constructor invocations <a href="classes.doc.html#78435">(&#167;8.8.5)</a> are handled specially <a href="defAssign.doc.html#56210">(&#167;16.8)</a>; although they are syntactically similar to expression statements containing method invocations, they are not expression statements and therefore the rules of this section do not apply to explicit constructor invocations.<p>

Let C be a class, and let V be a blank <code>final</code> member field of C, declared in a superclass of C. Then: <p>
<ul><a name="57782"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned (and moreover is not definitely unassigned) before the block that is the body of a constructor, or instance initializer of C.
<a name="57787"></a>
<li>V is definitely assigned (and moreover is not definitely unassigned) before every instance variable initializer of C.
