<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<P>
<B>ypbind</B>
<DD>finds the server for NIS domains and maintains the NIS binding information. The client (normaly the NIS routines in the standard C library) could get the information over RPC from
<B>ypbind</B>
or read the binding files. The binding files resides in the directory
<I>/var/yp/binding</I>
and are conventionally named
<B>[domainname].[version]</B>. The supported versions are 1 and 2. There could be several such files since it is possible for an NIS client to be bound to more than one domain.
<P>

After a binding has been established,
<B>ypbind</B>
will send YPPROC_DOMAIN requests to the current NIS server at 20 seconds intervals. If it doesn't get an response or the NIS server reports that he doesn't have this domain any longer,
<B>ypbind</B>
will search for a new NIS server. All 15 minutes
<B>ypbind</B>
will check to see if the current NIS server is the fastest. If it find a server which answers faster, it will switch to this server. You could tell
<B>ypbind</B>
to use network broadcasts to find a new server, what is insecure, or you could give it a list of known secure servers. In this case
<B>ypbind</B>
will send a ping to all servers and binds to first one which answers.
<P>

Unless the option
<B>-debug</B>
is used, ypbind detaches itself from the controlling terminal and puts itself into background.
<B>ypbind</B>
uses
<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?3+syslog">syslog</A></B>(3)
for logging errors and warnings. At startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP,
<B>ypbind</B>
parses the file
<I>/etc/yp.conf</I>
and tries to use the entries for its initial binding.
<P>

A broadcast entry in the configuration file will overwrite a ypserver/server entry and a ypserver/server entry broadcast. If all given server are down,
<B>ypbind</B>
will
<B>not</B>
switch to use broadcast.
<B>ypbind</B>
will try at first
<I>/etc/hosts</I>
and then
<B>DNS</B>
for resolving the hosts names from
<I>/etc/yp.conf</I>. If
<B>ypbind</B>
couldn't reconfigure the search order, it will use only
<B>DNS</B>. If
<B>DNS</B>
isn't available, you could only use IP-addresses in
<I>/etc/hosts</I>.
<B>ypbind</B>
could only reconfigure the search order with glibc 2.x. If the
<B>-broadcast</B>
option is specified,
<B>ypbind</B>
will ignore the configuration file. If the file does not exist or if there are no valid entries,
<B>ypbind</B>
exit.
<P>

This
<B>ypbind</B>
version listens for DBUS messages from NetworkManager. If no NetworkManager is running at startup,
<B>ypbind</B>
will behave as usual and assumes there is a working network connection. If NetworkManager is running on the system, ypbind will only search and providde NIS informations, if NetworkManager tells that a network connection is available. If NetworkManager establishes a connection,
<B>ypbind</B>
will reread all configuration files, registers at the local portmapper and try to search NIS servers. If NetworkManager drops a connection,
<B>ypbind</B>
will unregister from portmapper.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-broadcast</B><DD>
Send a broadcast to request the information needed to bind to a specific NIS server. With this option,
<I>/etc/yp.conf</I>
will be ignored.
<DT><B>-ypset</B><DD>
Allow
<B>root</B>
from any remote machine to change the binding for a domain via the
<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?8+ypset">ypset</A></B>(8)
command. By default, no one can change the binding. This option is really insecure. If you change a binding for a domain, all the current known servers for this domain will be forgotten. If the new server goes down,
<B>ypbind</B>
will use the old searchlist.
<DT><B>-ypsetme</B><DD>
The same as
<B>-ypset</B>, but only
<B>root</B>
on the local machine is allowed to chang the binding. Such requests are only allowd from
<B>loopback</B>.
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
<B>ypbind</B>
only checks if the config file has syntax errors and exits.
<DT><B>-debug</B><DD>
starts
<B>ypbind</B>
in debug mode.
<B>ypbind</B>
will not put itself into background, and error messages and debug output are written to standard error.
<DT><B>-verbose</B><DD>
Causes
<B>ypbind</B>
to <A HREF="/man/index.html?2+syslog">syslog</A>(2) any and all changes in the server its bound to.
<DT><B>-broken-server</B><DD>
lets
<B>ypbind</B>
accept answers from servers running on an illegal port number. This should usually be avoided, but is required by some
<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?8+ypserv">ypserv</A></B>(8)
versions.
<DT><B>-no-ping</B><DD>
<B>ypbind</B>
will not check if the binding is alive. This option is for use with dialup connections to prevent
<B>ypbind</B>
from keeping the connection unnessecarily open or causing autodials.
<DT><B>-p</B> port<DD>
<B>ypbind</B>
will bind itself to this port.
This makes it possible to have a router filter packets
to the NIS ports, so that access to this service from
hosts on the Internet can be restricted.
<DT><B>-f</B> configfile<DD>
<B>ypbind</B>
will use
<B>configfile</B>
and not
<I>/etc/yp.conf</I>
<DT><B>-local-only</B><DD>
<B>ypbind</B>
will only bind to the loopback device and is not reacheable from a remote network.
<DT><B>-ping-interval</B> ping-interval<DD>
The default value for
<B>ypbind</B>
to check, if a NIS server is still reacheable, is 20 seconds. With this options another frequency in seconds can be specified.
<DT><B>-no-dbus</B><DD>
Disables DBUS support if compiled in.
<DT><B>--version</B><DD>
Prints the version number
