<H2>NAME</H2>

NetworkManager - network management daemon
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>NetworkManager [--no-daemon] [--pid-file=&lt;filename&gt;] [--state-file=&lt;filename&gt;] [--config=&lt;filename&gt;] [--plugins=&lt;plugin1&gt;,plugin2&gt;,...] [--log-level=&lt;level&gt;] [--log-domains=&lt;domain1&gt;,&lt;domain2&gt;,...]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <I>NetworkManager</I> daemon attempts to make  networking configuration and
operation as painless and automatic as possible by managing the primary network
connection and other network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile
Broadband devices.  NetworkManager will connect any network device when a
connection for that device becomes available, unless that behavior is disabled.
Information about networking is exported via a D-Bus interface to any interested
application, providing a rich API with which to inspect and control network
settings and operation.

NetworkManager will execute scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d
directory in alphabetical order in response to network events.  Each script
should be (a) a regular file, (b) owned by root, (c) not writable by group or
other, (d) not set-uid, (e) and executable by the owner.  Each script receives
two arguments, the first being the interface name of the device just activated,
and second an action.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>up</I>

<DD>
The interface has been activated.  The environment contains more information
about the interface; CONNECTION_UUID contains the UUID of the connection.  Other
variables are IP4_ADDRESS_N where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4 addresses - 1),
in the format &quot;address/prefix gateway&quot;.  IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES contains the number
addresses the script may expect.  IP4_NAMESERVERS contains a space-separated
list of the DNS servers, and IP4_DOMAINS contains a space-separated list of the
search domains.  Routes use the format IP4_ROUTE_N where N is a number from 0
to (# IPv4 routes - 1), in the format &quot;address/prefix next-hop metric&quot;, and
IP4_NUM_ROUTES contains the number of routes to expect.  If the connection used
DHCP for address configuration, the received DHCP configuration is passed in the
environment using standard DHCP option names, prefixed with &quot;DHCP4_&quot;, like
&quot;DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar&quot;.
<DT><I>down</I>

<DD>
The interface has been deactivated.
<DT><I>vpn-up</I>

<DD>
A VPN connection has been activated.  The environment contains the connection
UUID in the variable CONNECTION_UUID.
<DT><I>vpn-down</I>

<DD>
A VPN connection has been deactivated.
<DT><I>hostname</I>

<DD>
The system hostname has been updated.  Use <A HREF="/man/index.html?2+gethostname">gethostname</A>(2) to retrieve it.
<DT><I>dhcp4-change</I>

<DD>
The DHCPv4 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).
<DT><I>dhcp6-change</I>

<DD>
The DHCPv6 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The following options are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>--no-daemon</I>

<DD>
Do not daemonize.  This is useful for debugging, and directs log output to the
controlling terminal in addition to syslog.
<DT><I>--pid-file=&lt;filename&gt;</I>

<DD>
Specify location of a PID file.  The PID file is used for storing PID of the
running proccess and prevents running multiple instances.
<DT><I>--state-file=&lt;filename&gt;</I>

<DD>
Specify file for storing state of the NetworkManager persistently.  If not specified,
the default value of '&lt;LOCALSTATEDIR&gt;/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state' is
used; where &lt;LOCALSTATEDIR&gt; is dependent on your distribution (usually it's /var).
<DT><I>--config=&lt;filename&gt;</I>

<DD>
Specify configuration file to set up various settings for NetworkManager.  If not
specified, the default value of '&lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt;/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf'
is used with a fallback to the older 'nm-system-settings.conf' if located in
the same directory; where &lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt; is dependent on your distribution (usually
it's /etc).  See <B><A HREF="/man/index.html?5+NetworkManager.conf">NetworkManager.conf</A></B>(5) for more information on configuration
file.
<DT><I>--plugins=&lt;plugin1&gt;,&lt;plugin2&gt;, ...</I>

<DD>
List plugins used to manage system-wide connection settings.   This list has
preference over plugins specified in the configuration file.  Currently supported
plugins are: keyfile, ifcfg-rh, ifcfg-suse, ifupdown.
See <B><A HREF="/man/index.html?5+NetworkManager.conf">NetworkManager.conf</A></B>(5) for more information on the plugins.
<DT><I>--log-level=&lt;level&gt;</I>

<DD>
Sets how much information NetworkManager sends to the log destination (usually
syslog's &quot;daemon&quot; facility).  By default, only informational, warning, and error
messages are logged.  See <B><A HREF="/man/index.html?5+NetworkManager.conf">NetworkManager.conf</A></B>(5) for more information on
log levels and domains.
<DT><I>--log-domains=&lt;domain1&gt;,&lt;domain2&gt;, ...</I>

<DD>
Sets which operations are logged to the log destination (usually syslog).  By
default, most domains are logging-enabled.  See <B><A HREF="/man/index.html?5+NetworkManager.conf">NetworkManager.conf</A></B>(5) for
more information on log levels and domains.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEBUGGING</H2>

The following environment variables are supported to help debugging.  When used
in conjunction with the &quot;--no-daemon&quot; option (thus echoing PPP and DHCP helper
output to stdout) these can quickly help pinpoint the source of connection
issues.  Also see the --log-level and --log-domains to enable debug logging inside
NetworkManager itself.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>NM_PPP_DEBUG</I>

<DD>
When set to anything, causes NetworkManager to turn on PPP debugging in pppd,
which logs all PPP and PPTP frames and client/server exchanges.
