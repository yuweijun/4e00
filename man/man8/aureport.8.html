aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of audit daemon logs
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>aureport</B>

[<I>options</I>]

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>aureport</B> is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit system logs. The aureport utility can also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. The reports have a column label at the top to help with interpretation of the various fields. Except for the main summary report, all reports have the audit event number. You can subsequently lookup the full event with ausearch <B>-a</B> <I>event number</I>. You may need to specify start &amp; stop times if you get multiple hits. The reports produced by aureport can be used as building blocks for more complicated analysis.

<DD>
Report about avc messages
<DT><B>-c</B>,&nbsp;<B>--config</B>

<DD>
Report about config changes
<DT><B>-cr</B>,&nbsp;<B>--crypto</B>

<DD>
Report about crypto events
<DT><B>-e</B>,&nbsp;<B>--event</B>

<DD>
Report about events
<DT><B>-f</B>,&nbsp;<B>--file</B>

<DD>
Report about files
<DT><B>--failed</B>

<DD>
Report about hosts
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>

<DT><B>-i</B>,&nbsp;<B>--interpret</B>

<DD>
Interpret  numeric  entities into text. For example, uid is converted to account name. The conversion is done using the current resources  of  the machine where the search is being run. If you have renamed the accounts, or don't have the  same  accounts  on your machine, you could get misleading results.
<DT><B>-if</B>,&nbsp;<B>--input</B>&nbsp;<I>file</I>

<DD>
Use the given <I>file</I> instead if the logs. This is to aid analysis where the logs have been moved to another machine or only part of a log was saved.
<DT><B>--input-logs</B>

<DD>
Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for analysis. This is needed if you are using aureport from a cron job.
<DT><B>-k</B>,&nbsp;<B>--key</B>

<DD>
Report about audit rule keys
<DT><B>-l</B>,&nbsp;<B>--login</B>

<DD>
Report about syscalls
<DT><B>--success</B>

<DD>
Only select successful events for processing in the reports. The default is both success and failed events.
<DT><B>--summary</B>

<DD>
Run the summary report that gives a total of the elements of the main report. Not all reports have a summary.
<DT><B>-t</B>,&nbsp;<B>--log</B>

<DT><B>--tty</B>

<DD>
Report about tty keystrokes
<DT><B>-te</B>,&nbsp;<B>--end</B>&nbsp;[<I>end-date</I>]&nbsp;[<I>end-time</I>]

<DD>

<B>today</B>

is assumed. If the time is omitted,

is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME environmental variable.
<P>
You may also use the word: <B>now</B>, <B>recent</B>, <B>today</B>, <B>yesterday</B>, <B>this-week</B>, <B>week-ago</B>, <B>this-month</B>, <B>this-year</B>. <B>Today</B> means starting now. <B>Recent</B> is 10 minutes ago. <B>Yesterday</B> is 1 second after midnight the previous day. <B>This-week</B> means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week determined by your locale (see <B>localtime</B>). <B>This-month</B> means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. <B>This-year</B> means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the first month.
<DT><B>-tm</B>,&nbsp;<B>--terminal</B>
