<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<P>

smp_utils is a package of utilities. Each utility sends a Serial Attached
SCSI (SAS) Management Protocol (SMP) request to a <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> (a SMP
target). If an error occurs then an error message is sent to stderr. If
no error occurs, the response is decoded (the default), output in ASCII
hex (when <I>--hex</I> is given) or output in binary to stdout (when
<I>--raw</I> is given).
<P>

If <I>SMP_DEVICE[,N]</I> is not given then the value in the environment
variable SMP_UTILS_DEVICE is used.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTERFACE</H2>

Currently there are multiple interfaces that allow SMP functions to
be passed through to a SMP target.
<P>

One method is to have a <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> which is actually the SMP
initiator (e.g. '/dev/mptctl,0'). In this case the SMP target's
SAS address must be supplied with <I>--sa=SAS_ADDR</I>.
<P>

Another method is to have a <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> which represents the SMP target.
In this case no <I>SAS_ADDRESS</I> needs to be given (since it is implicit).
This method may be simpler but it has some limitations (e.g. it assumes the
SMP target has already been discovered which may not be the case for the
initial discovery process).
<P>

Each utility in smp_utils attempts to work out which interface it has been
given by examining the <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> file. There are three interfaces
supported currently:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>mpt</B><DD>
This specifies the MPT fusion SAS pass-through which uses the '/dev/mptctl'
or '/dev/mpt2ctl' device node. If mpt drivers are loaded but '/dev/mptctl'
or '/dev/mpt2ctl' are not present then a 'modprobe mptctl' command may be
needed in Linux. If there are multiple mpt fusion controllers (HBAs) in the
computer, then the user will need to specify which one to use with the
syntax: '/dev/mptctl,&lt;n&gt;' where &lt;n&gt; is the &quot;ioc_num&quot;. This number can be found
in the log where the mptsas driver is registered. In Linux it can be found
in '/proc/scsi/mptsas/&lt;host_no&gt;' in the 2.4 series and additionally
in '/sys/class/scsi_host/host&lt;n&gt;/unique_id' in the 2.6 series. When this
interface is used the <I>--sa=SAS_ADDR</I> option must be given to specify
the SAS address of the SMP target. When the mptctl driver is loaded in
Linux there should be a character device node at '/dev/mptctl' with
major 10 and minor 220. Alternatively there may be a character device node
at '/dev/mpt2ctl' with major 10 and minor 221.
<DT><B>sgv4</B> (<B>sg</B>)<DD>
This interface is more generic and supported in the linux 2.6.24 kernel
and beyond. The SMP functions are passed to the kernel using a format
known as &quot;SCSI Generic Version 4&quot; which gives this interface its
name: &quot;sgv4&quot; or just &quot;sg&quot;. The SAS transport layer within the SCSI
sub-system unpacks the SMP requests and forwards them to SAS low level
drivers that support this interface. The <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> is either a
member of the '/sys/class/bsg' directory or a device node made by the
bsg driver. Such device nodes are dynamic (i.e. they don't have a fixed
major number) and should correspond to the major and minor numbers
found in the 'sys/class/bsg/&lt;smp_target_device&gt;/dev' file.
<DT><B>tpl</B> (<B>ai</B>)<DD>
This interface is currently used by one adaptec 94xx driver. The &quot;device&quot;
name will usually be &quot;smp_portal&quot; and it will be found within the sysfs
file system (typically mounted under &quot;/sys&quot;). The target SMP SAS address
is implicit (as is the SMP initiator). Either 'tpl' or 'ai' can be used
to specify this interface.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

If the device name is not given then the SMP_UTILS_DEVICE environment
variable is checked and if present its contents are used as the device name.
<P>

If the SAS address (of the SMP target) is not given and it is
required (i.e. it is not implicit in the device name) then
the SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR environment variable is checked and if present
its contents are used as the SAS address. SAS addresses are usually given
in hex indicated by a leading '0x' or trailing 'h'.
<P>

In both cases command line options override the corresponding
environment variable.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMON OPTIONS</H2>

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
If an option takes a numeric argument then that argument is assumed to
be decimal unless otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading &quot;0x&quot; or a
trailing &quot;h&quot;).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-E</B>, <B>--expected</B>=<I>EX</I><DD>
revision 4a of the SAS-2 draft introduced an 'expected expander change
count' field in some SMP requests. The idea is to detect other SMP
initiators trying to change the state of an expander. The value <I>EX</I>
is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value. When <I>EX</I>
is greater than zero then if the value doesn't match the expander
change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request
arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function
result of &quot;invalid expander change count&quot; in the response.
<DT><B>-h</B>, <B>--help</B><DD>
output the usage message for the utility then exit.
<DT><B>-H</B>, <B>--hex</B><DD>
output the response in hexadecimal.
<DT><B>-I</B>, <B>--interface</B>=<I>PARAMS</I><DD>
interface specific parameters. This option is usually not needed since the
interface type is guessed by a utility based on the characteristics of the
given <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> argument or what is in the corresponding environment
variables. <I>PARAMS</I> is of the form: <I>INTF[,force]</I>.
If the guess doesn't work then the interface can be specified by giving
a <I>INTF</I> of either 'mpt', 'sgv4' or 'tpl' ( with 'ai' being a synonym
for 'tpl'). Sanity checks are still performed and a utility may refuse if
it doesn't agree with the given <I>INTF</I>. If the user is really sure then
adding a ',force' will force the utility to use the given interface.
<DT><B>-r</B>, <B>--raw</B><DD>
send the response to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.
<DT><B>-s</B>, <B>--sa</B>=<I>SAS_ADDR</I><DD>
specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. Typically this is an
expander. This option may not be needed if the <I>SMP_DEVICE</I> has the
target's SAS address associated with it. The <I>SAS_ADDR</I> is in decimal
but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it. If this
option is not given then the value in the environment variable
SMP_UTILS_SAS_ADDR is used.
<DT><B>-v</B>, <B>--verbose</B><DD>
increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.
<DT><B>-V</B>, <B>--version</B><DD>
print the version string and then exit.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

To aid scripts that call these utilities, the exit status is set to
indicate success (0) or failure (1 or more):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>0</B>

<DD>
success
<DT><B>1 - 63</B>

<DD>
reserved for SMP function result codes. See SAS draft or standard,
application layer, management application layer, SMP functions.
Here are some common function result codes: 1 [unknown SMP function],
2 [SMP function failed], 16 [phy does not exist], 17 [index does not
exist], 18 [phy does not support SATA] and 19 [unknown phy operation].
<DT><B>91</B>

<DD>
syntax error. Either illegal options, options with bad arguments or
a combination of options that is not permitted.
<DT><B>92</B>

<DD>
the utility is unable to open, close or use the given <I>SMP_DEVICE</I>.
The given file name could be incorrect or there may be permission
problems. Adding the <I>--verbose</I> option may give more information.
<DT><B>97</B>

<DD>
the response to a SMP function failed sanity checks.
<DT><B>99</B>

<DD>
any error that can't be categorized into values 1 to 97 may yield
this value. This includes transport and operating system errors.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Finding the SAS address of an expander can be a challenge in some
environments. An enclosure containing one or more expanders may
have the expander SAS address(es) printed on the back of the
device, a bit like ethernet MAC addresses.
<P>

In the Linux 2.6 kernel series the expander SAS address may well
be in the sysfs tree but it is not always easy to find. Doing
this search may help:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;find&nbsp;/sys&nbsp;-name&nbsp;&quot;sas_device:expander*&quot;
<P>

Then change directory to any path found and call 'cat sas_address'
<P>

Another approach is to work backwards from SCSI devices (i.e. logical
units). The protocol specific port log page (log page 18h) contains
fields for the &quot;attached SAS address&quot;. sg_logs from the sg3_utils
package could be used like this:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;sg_logs&nbsp;--page=18h&nbsp;/dev/sdb
<P>

Any given &quot;attached SAS address&quot; is either a HBA, an expander or 0
indicating that port is not connected.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

To date SAS has three generations. The first two generations are approved
standards: the original SAS (SAS ANSI INCITS 376-2003) and SAS 1.1 (INCITS
417-2006). SAS-2 technical work is ongoing and at the time of writing the
most recent draft is sas2r15.pdf (see section 10.4.3 for SMP functions).
To avoid confusion, the three generations of SAS will be referred to in
these man pages as SAS 1, 1.1 and 2 . Drafts, including those just prior to
standardization can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.t10.org">http://www.t10.org</A> site.
<P>

The two utilities for reading and writing to GPIO registers, smp_read_gpio
and smp_write_gpio, are defined in the Small Form Factor document SFF-8485
found at <A HREF="http://www.sffcommittee.com">http://www.sffcommittee.com</A> .
<P>

In this section of each utility's man page is the first standard in which
the associated SMP function appeared and whether there have been significant
additions in later standards.
<P>

The COVERAGE file in the smp_utils source tarball shows the mapping between
all SMP function names defined in the standards, the versions of those
standards in which those SMP functions are defined and the corresponding
smp_utils utility names. A lot of extra SMP functions have been added in
SAS-2 and many do not have corresponding utilities at this time.
