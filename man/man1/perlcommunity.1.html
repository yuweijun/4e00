<H2>NAME</H2>

perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl community
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl community, which is
far too large and diverse to provide a detailed listing. If any specific niche
has been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but an omission for the sake
of brevity.
<P>

The Perl community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a large amount of
evidence that the Perl users apply <FONT SIZE="-1">TMTOWTDI</FONT> to all endeavors, not just
programming. From websites, to <FONT SIZE="-1">IRC</FONT>, to mailing lists, there is more than one
way to get involved in the community.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Where to find the community</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
There is a central directory for the Perl community: &lt;<A HREF="http://perl.org">http://perl.org</A>&gt;
maintained by the Perl Foundation (&lt;<A HREF="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">http://www.perlfoundation.org/</A>&gt;),
which tracks and provides services for a variety of other community sites.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mailing lists and Newsgroups</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Perl runs on e-mail, there is no doubt about it. The Camel book was originally
written mostly over e-mail and today Perl's development is co-ordinated through
mailing lists. The largest repository of Perl mailing lists is located at
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.perl.org">http://lists.perl.org</A>&gt;.
<P>

Most Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both users and
contributors. If you don't see a certain project listed at
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.perl.org">http://lists.perl.org</A>&gt;, check the particular website for that project.
Most mailing lists are archived at &lt;<A HREF="http://nntp.perl.org/">http://nntp.perl.org/</A>&gt;.
<P>

There are also plenty of Perl related newsgroups located under
<TT>&quot;comp.lang.perl.*&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><FONT SIZE="-1">IRC</FONT></H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The Perl community has a rather large <FONT SIZE="-1">IRC</FONT> presence. For starters, it has its
own <FONT SIZE="-1">IRC</FONT> network, &lt;<A HREF="irc://irc.perl.org">irc://irc.perl.org</A>&gt;. General (not help-oriented) chat can be
found at &lt;<A HREF="irc://irc.perl.org/#perl">irc://irc.perl.org/#perl</A>&gt;. Many other more specific chats are also
hosted on the network. Information about irc.perl.org is located on the
network's website: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.irc.perl.org">http://www.irc.perl.org</A>&gt;. For a more help oriented #perl,
check out &lt;<A HREF="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl">irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl</A>&gt;. Perl 6 development also has a
presence in &lt;<A HREF="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6">irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6</A>&gt;. Most Perl-related channels will
be kind enough to point you in the right direction if you ask nicely.
<P>

Any large <FONT SIZE="-1">IRC</FONT> network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to have a #perl channel,
with varying activity levels.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Websites</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into two large
categories: forums and news websites. There are many Perl related
websites, so only a few of the community's largest are mentioned here.
<P>

<I>News sites</I>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&lt;<A HREF="http://perl.com/">http://perl.com/</A>&gt;<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
Run by O'Reilly Media (The publisher of the Camel Book among other
Perl-related literature), perl.com provides current Perl news, articles, and
resources for Perl developers as well as a directory of other useful websites.
<DT>&lt;<A HREF="http://use.perl.org/">http://use.perl.org/</A>&gt;<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
use Perl; provides a slashdot-style Perl news website covering all things Perl,
from minutes of the meetings of the Perl 6 Design team to conference
announcements with (ir)relevant discussion.
</DL>
<P>

<I>Forums</I>
<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</A>&gt;<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
PerlMonks is one of the largest Perl forums, and describes itself as ``A place
for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their Perl skills.'' and ``A
community which allows everyone to grow and learn from each other.''
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>User Groups</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers chapters. A Perl Mongers
chapter is a local user group which typically holds regular in-person meetings,
both social and technical; helps organize local conferences, workshops, and
hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other continual contact method for
its members to keep in touch.
<P>

To find your local Perl Mongers (or <FONT SIZE="-1">PM</FONT> as they're commonly abbreviated) group
check the international Perl Mongers directory at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</A>&gt;.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Workshops</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops where Perl is taught
in a variety of ways. At the workshops, subjects range from a beginner's
introduction (such as the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop's ``Zero To Perl'') to much
more advanced subjects.
<P>

There are several great resources for locating workshops: the
websites mentioned above, the
calendar mentioned below, and the <FONT SIZE="-1">YAPC</FONT> Europe
website, &lt;<A HREF="http://www.yapceurope.org/">http://www.yapceurope.org/</A>&gt;, which is probably the best resource for
European Perl events.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Hackathons</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl hackers gather to
do just that, hack nonstop for an extended (several day) period on a specific
project or projects. Information about hackathons can be located in the same
place as information about workshops as well as in
&lt;<A HREF="irc://irc.perl.org/#perl">irc://irc.perl.org/#perl</A>&gt;.
<P>

If you have never been to a hackathon, here are a few basic things you need to
know before attending: have a working laptop and know how to use it; check out
the involved projects before hand; have the necessary version control client;
and bring backup equipment (an extra <FONT SIZE="-1">LAN</FONT> cable, additional power strips, etc.)
because someone will forget.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Conventions</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
Perl has two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference (now part of <FONT SIZE="-1">OSCON</FONT>),
put on by O'Reilly, and Yet Another Perl Conference or <FONT SIZE="-1">YAPC</FONT> (pronounced
yap-see), which is localized into several regional YAPCs (North America,
Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by the Perl community. For more
information about either conference, check out their respective web pages:
<FONT SIZE="-1">OSCON</FONT> &lt;<A HREF="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/</A>&gt;; <FONT SIZE="-1">YAPC</FONT> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.yapc.org">http://www.yapc.org</A>&gt;.
<P>

A relatively new conference franchise with a large Perl portion is the
Open Source Developers Conference or <FONT SIZE="-1">OSDC</FONT>. First held in Australia it has
recently also spread to Israel. More information can be found at:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.osdc.com.au/">http://www.osdc.com.au/</A>&gt; for Australia, and &lt;<A HREF="http://www.osdc.org.il">http://www.osdc.org.il</A>&gt;
for Israel.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Calendar of Perl Events</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
The Perl Review, &lt;<A HREF="http://www.theperlreview.com">http://www.theperlreview.com</A>&gt; maintains a website
and Google calendar
(&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar">http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar</A>&gt;) for tracking
workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings, and other events. Views
of this calendar are at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.perl.org/events.html">http://www.perl.org/events.html</A>&gt; and
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.yapc.org">http://www.yapc.org</A>&gt;.
<P>

Not every event or Perl Mongers group is on that calendar, so don't lose
heart if you don't see yours posted. To have your event or group listed,
contact brian d foy (<A HREF="mailto:brian@theperlreview.com">brian@theperlreview.com</A>).
