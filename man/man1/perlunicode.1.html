perlunicode - Unicode support in Perl
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Important Caveats</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Unicode support is an extensive requirement. While Perl does not
implement the Unicode standard or the accompanying technical reports
from cover to cover, Perl does support many Unicode features.
<P>

People who want to learn to use Unicode in Perl, should probably read
the Perl Unicode tutorial, perlunitut, before reading
this reference document.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Input and Output Layers<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Perl knows when a filehandle uses Perl's internal Unicode encodings
(<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>, or UTF-EBCDIC if in <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT>) if the filehandle is opened with
the ``:utf8'' layer.  Other encodings can be converted to Perl's
encoding on input or from Perl's encoding on output by use of the
``:encoding(...)''  layer.  See open.


<P>


To indicate that Perl source itself is in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>, use <TT>&quot;use utf8;&quot;</TT>.
<DT>Regular Expressions<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The regular expression compiler produces polymorphic opcodes.  That is,
the pattern adapts to the data and automatically switches to the Unicode
character scheme when presented with data that is internally encoded in
<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> --- or instead uses a traditional byte scheme when presented with
byte data.
<DT>use utf8 still needed to enable <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8/UTF-EBCDIC</FONT> in scripts<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
As a compatibility measure, the <TT>&quot;use utf8&quot;</TT> pragma must be explicitly
included to enable recognition of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> in the Perl scripts themselves
(in string or regular expression literals, or in identifier names) on
ASCII-based machines or to recognize UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC-based
machines.  <B>These are the only times when an explicit </B>&quot;use utf8&quot;<B>
is needed.</B>  See utf8.
<DT>BOM-marked scripts and <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT> scripts autodetected<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
If a Perl script begins marked with the Unicode <FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT> (<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16LE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF16-BE</FONT>,
or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>), or if the script looks like non-BOM-marked <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT> of either
endianness, Perl will correctly read in the script as Unicode.
(BOMless <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> cannot be effectively recognized or differentiated from
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> 8859-1 or other eight-bit encodings.)
<DT>use encoding needed to upgrade non-Latin-1 byte strings<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
By default, there is a fundamental asymmetry in Perl's Unicode model:
implicit upgrading from byte strings to Unicode strings assumes that
they were encoded in <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>ISO</I></FONT><I> 8859-1 (Latin-1)</I>, but Unicode strings are
downgraded with <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoding.  This happens because the first 256
codepoints in Unicode happens to agree with Latin-1.


<P>


See ``Byte and Character Semantics'' for more details.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Byte and Character Semantics</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Beginning with version 5.6, Perl uses logically-wide characters to
represent strings internally.
<P>

In future, Perl-level operations will be expected to work with
characters rather than bytes.
<P>

However, as an interim compatibility measure, Perl aims to
provide a safe migration path from byte semantics to character
semantics for programs.  For operations where Perl can unambiguously
decide that the input data are characters, Perl switches to
character semantics.  For operations where this determination cannot
be made without additional information from the user, Perl decides in
favor of compatibility and chooses to use byte semantics.
<P>

Under byte semantics, when <TT>&quot;use locale&quot;</TT> is in effect, Perl uses the 
semantics associated with the current locale.  Absent a <TT>&quot;use locale&quot;</TT>, Perl
currently uses US-ASCII (or Basic Latin in Unicode terminology) byte semantics,
meaning that characters whose ordinal numbers are in the range 128 - 255 are
undefined except for their ordinal numbers.  This means that none have case
(upper and lower), nor are any a member of character classes, like <TT>&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;</TT>
or <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT>.
(But all do belong to the <TT>&quot;\W&quot;</TT> class or the Perl regular expression extension
<TT>&quot;[:^alpha:]&quot;</TT>.)
<P>

This behavior preserves compatibility with earlier versions of Perl,
which allowed byte semantics in Perl operations only if
none of the program's inputs were marked as being as source of Unicode
character data.  Such data may come from filehandles, from calls to
external programs, from information provided by the system (such as <TT>%ENV</TT>),
or from literals and constants in the source text.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;bytes&quot;</TT> pragma will always, regardless of platform, force byte
semantics in a particular lexical scope.  See bytes.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;utf8&quot;</TT> pragma is primarily a compatibility device that enables
recognition of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-</FONT>(8|EBCDIC) in literals encountered by the parser.
Note that this pragma is only required while Perl defaults to byte
semantics; when character semantics become the default, this pragma
may become a no-op.  See utf8.
<P>

Unless explicitly stated, Perl operators use character semantics
for Unicode data and byte semantics for non-Unicode data.
The decision to use character semantics is made transparently.  If
input data comes from a Unicode source---for example, if a character
encoding layer is added to a filehandle or a literal Unicode
string constant appears in a program---character semantics apply.
Otherwise, byte semantics are in effect.  The <TT>&quot;bytes&quot;</TT> pragma should
be used to force byte semantics on Unicode data.
<P>

If strings operating under byte semantics and strings with Unicode
character data are concatenated, the new string will have 
character semantics.  This can cause surprises: See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">BUGS</FONT>'', below
<P>

Under character semantics, many operations that formerly operated on
bytes now operate on characters. A character in Perl is
logically just a number ranging from 0 to 2**31 or so. Larger
characters may encode into longer sequences of bytes internally, but
this internal detail is mostly hidden for Perl code.
See perluniintro for more.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Effects of Character Semantics</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Character semantics have the following effects:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Strings---including hash keys---and regular expression patterns may
contain characters that have an ordinal value larger than 255.


<P>


If you use a Unicode editor to edit your program, Unicode characters may
occur directly within the literal strings in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoding, or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>.
(The former requires a <FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT> or <TT>&quot;use utf8&quot;</TT>, the latter requires a <FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT>.)


<P>


Unicode characters can also be added to a string by using the <TT>&quot;\x{...}&quot;</TT>
notation.  The Unicode code for the desired character, in hexadecimal,
should be placed in the braces. For instance, a smiley face is
<TT>&quot;\x{263A}&quot;</TT>.  This encoding scheme works for all characters, but
for characters under 0x100, note that Perl may use an 8 bit encoding
internally, for optimization and/or backward compatibility.


<P>


Additionally, if you


<P>




<PRE>
   use charnames ':full';

</PRE>




<P>


you can use the <TT>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</TT> notation and put the official Unicode
character name within the braces, such as <TT>&quot;\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
If an appropriate encoding is specified, identifiers within the
Perl script may contain Unicode alphanumeric characters, including
ideographs.  Perl does not currently attempt to canonicalize variable
names.
<DT>*<DD>
Regular expressions match characters instead of bytes.  ``.'' matches
a character instead of a byte.
<DT>*<DD>
Character classes in regular expressions match characters instead of
bytes and match against the character properties specified in the
Unicode properties database.  <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> can be used to match a Japanese
ideograph, for instance.
<DT>*<DD>
Named Unicode properties, scripts, and block ranges may be used like
character classes via the <TT>&quot;\p{}&quot;</TT> ``matches property'' construct and
the <TT>&quot;\P{}&quot;</TT> negation, ``doesn't match property''.


<P>


See ``Unicode Character Properties'' for more details.


<P>


You can define your own character properties and use them
in the regular expression with the <TT>&quot;\p{}&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;\P{}&quot;</TT> construct.


<P>


See ``User-Defined Character Properties'' for more details.
<DT>*<DD>
The special pattern <TT>&quot;\X&quot;</TT> matches any extended Unicode
sequence--``a combining character sequence'' in Standardese---where the
first character is a base character and subsequent characters are mark
characters that apply to the base character.  <TT>&quot;\X&quot;</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>&quot;(?&gt;\PM\pM*)&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;tr///&quot;</TT> operator translates characters instead of bytes.  Note
that the <TT>&quot;tr///CU&quot;</TT> functionality has been removed.  For similar
functionality see pack('U0', ...) and pack('C0', ...).
<DT>*<DD>
Case translation operators use the Unicode case translation tables
when character input is provided.  Note that <TT>&quot;uc()&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;\U&quot;</TT> in
interpolated strings, translates to uppercase, while <TT>&quot;ucfirst&quot;</TT>,
or <TT>&quot;\u&quot;</TT> in interpolated strings, translates to titlecase in languages
that make the distinction.
<DT>*<DD>
Most operators that deal with positions or lengths in a string will
automatically switch to using character positions, including
<TT>&quot;chop()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;chomp()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;substr()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;pos()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;index()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;rindex()&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;sprintf()&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;write()&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;length()&quot;</TT>.  An operator that
specifically does not switch is <TT>&quot;vec()&quot;</TT>.  Operators that really don't 
care include operators that treat strings as a bucket of bits such as 
<TT>&quot;sort()&quot;</TT>, and operators dealing with filenames.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;pack()&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;unpack()&quot;</TT> letter <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> does <I>not</I> change, since it is often 
used for byte-oriented formats.  Again, think <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> in the C language.


<P>


There is a new <TT>&quot;U&quot;</TT> specifier that converts between Unicode characters
and code points. There is also a <TT>&quot;W&quot;</TT> specifier that is the equivalent of
<TT>&quot;chr&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;ord&quot;</TT> and properly handles character values even if they are above 255.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;chr()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ord()&quot;</TT> functions work on characters, similar to
<TT>&quot;pack(&quot;W&quot;)&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;unpack(&quot;W&quot;)&quot;</TT>, <I>not</I> <TT>&quot;pack(&quot;C&quot;)&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;unpack(&quot;C&quot;)&quot;</TT>.  <TT>&quot;pack(&quot;C&quot;)&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;unpack(&quot;C&quot;)&quot;</TT> are methods for
emulating byte-oriented <TT>&quot;chr()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ord()&quot;</TT> on Unicode strings.
While these methods reveal the internal encoding of Unicode strings,
that is not something one normally needs to care about at all.
<DT>*<DD>
The bit string operators, <TT>&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;</TT>, can operate on character data.
However, for backward compatibility, such as when using bit string
operations when characters are all less than 256 in ordinal value, one
should not use <TT>&quot;~&quot;</TT> (the bit complement) with characters of both
values less than 256 and values greater than 256.  Most importantly,
DeMorgan's laws (<TT>&quot;~($x|$y) eq ~$x&amp;~$y&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;~($x&amp;$y) eq ~$x|~$y&quot;</TT>)
will not hold.  The reason for this mathematical <I>faux pas</I> is that
the complement cannot return <B>both</B> the 8-bit (byte-wide) bit
complement <B>and</B> the full character-wide bit complement.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>lc()</I>, <I>uc()</I>, <I>lcfirst()</I>, and <I>ucfirst()</I> work for the following cases:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
the case mapping is from a single Unicode character to another
single Unicode character, or
<DT>*<DD>
the case mapping is from a single Unicode character to more
than one Unicode character.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


Things to do with locales (Lithuanian, Turkish, Azeri) do <B>not</B> work
since Perl does not understand the concept of Unicode locales.


<P>


See the Unicode Technical Report #21, Case Mappings, for more details.


<P>


But you can also define your own mappings to be used in the <I>lc()</I>,
<I>lcfirst()</I>, <I>uc()</I>, and <I>ucfirst()</I> (or their string-inlined versions).


<P>


See ``User-Defined Case Mappings'' for more details.

<DT>*<DD>
And finally, <TT>&quot;scalar reverse()&quot;</TT> reverses by character rather than by byte.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Unicode Character Properties</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Named Unicode properties, scripts, and block ranges may be used like
character classes via the <TT>&quot;\p{}&quot;</TT> ``matches property'' construct and
the <TT>&quot;\P{}&quot;</TT> negation, ``doesn't match property''.
<P>

For instance, <TT>&quot;\p{Lu}&quot;</TT> matches any character with the Unicode ``Lu''
(Letter, uppercase) property, while <TT>&quot;\p{M}&quot;</TT> matches any character
with an ``M'' (mark---accents and such) property.  Brackets are not
required for single letter properties, so <TT>&quot;\p{M}&quot;</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>&quot;\pM&quot;</TT>. Many predefined properties are available, such as
<TT>&quot;\p{Mirrored}&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;\p{Tibetan}&quot;</TT>.
<P>

The official Unicode script and block names have spaces and dashes as
separators, but for convenience you can use dashes, spaces, or
underbars, and case is unimportant. It is recommended, however, that
for consistency you use the following naming: the official Unicode
script, property, or block name (see below for the additional rules
that apply to block names) with whitespace and dashes removed, and the
words ``uppercase-first-lowercase-rest''. <TT>&quot;Latin-1 Supplement&quot;</TT> thus
becomes <TT>&quot;Latin1Supplement&quot;</TT>.
<P>

You can also use negation in both <TT>&quot;\p{}&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;\P{}&quot;</TT> by introducing a caret
(^) between the first brace and the property name: <TT>&quot;\p{^Tamil}&quot;</TT> is
equal to <TT>&quot;\P{Tamil}&quot;</TT>.
<P>

<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>NOTE:</B></FONT><B> the properties, scripts, and blocks listed here are as of
Unicode 5.0.0 in July 2006.</B>

Here are the basic Unicode General Category properties, followed by their

Single-letter properties match all characters in any of the
two-letter sub-properties starting with the same letter.
<TT>&quot;LC&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;L&amp;&quot;</TT> are special cases, which are aliases for the set of
<TT>&quot;Ll&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;Lu&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;Lt&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Because Perl hides the need for the user to understand the internal
representation of Unicode characters, there is no need to implement
the somewhat messy concept of surrogates. <TT>&quot;Cs&quot;</TT> is therefore not
supported.

<DT>Use of Is Prefix<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
For backward compatibility (with Perl 5.6), all properties mentioned
so far may have <TT>&quot;Is&quot;</TT> prepended to their name, so <TT>&quot;\P{IsLu}&quot;</TT>, for
example, is equal to <TT>&quot;\P{Lu}&quot;</TT>.
<DT>Blocks<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
In addition to <B>scripts</B>, Unicode also defines <B>blocks</B> of
characters.  The difference between scripts and blocks is that the
concept of scripts is closer to natural languages, while the concept
of blocks is more of an artificial grouping based on groups of 256
Unicode characters. For example, the <TT>&quot;Latin&quot;</TT> script contains letters
from many blocks but does not contain all the characters from those
blocks. It does not, for example, contain digits, because digits are
shared across many scripts. Digits and similar groups, like
punctuation, are in a category called <TT>&quot;Common&quot;</TT>.


<P>


For more about scripts, see the UAX#24 ``Script Names'':

   <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt</A>

</PRE>




<P>


Block names are given with the <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT> prefix. For example, the
Katakana block is referenced via <TT>&quot;\p{InKatakana}&quot;</TT>.  The <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>User-Defined Character Properties</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
You can define your own character properties by defining subroutines
whose names begin with ``In'' or ``Is''.  The subroutines can be defined in
any package.  The user-defined properties can be used in the regular
expression <TT>&quot;\p&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;\P&quot;</TT> constructs; if you are using a user-defined
property from a package other than the one you are in, you must specify
its package in the <TT>&quot;\p&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;\P&quot;</TT> construct.
<P>



<PRE>
    # assuming property IsForeign defined in Lang::
    package main;  # property package name required
    if ($txt =~ /\p{Lang::IsForeign}+/) { ... }

    package Lang;  # property package name not required
    if ($txt =~ /\p{IsForeign}+/) { ... }

</PRE>


<P>

Note that the effect is compile-time and immutable once defined.
<P>

The subroutines must return a specially-formatted string, with one
or more newline-separated lines.  Each line must be one of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
A single hexadecimal number denoting a Unicode code point to include.
<DT>*<DD>
Two hexadecimal numbers separated by horizontal whitespace (space or
tabular characters) denoting a range of Unicode code points to include.
<DT>*<DD>
Something to include, prefixed by ``+'': a built-in character
property (prefixed by ``utf8::'') or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code
points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.
<DT>*<DD>
Something to exclude, prefixed by ``-'': an existing character
property (prefixed by ``utf8::'') or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code
points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.
<DT>*<DD>
Something to negate, prefixed ``!'': an existing character
property (prefixed by ``utf8::'') or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code
points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.
<DT>*<DD>
Something to intersect with, prefixed by ``&amp;'': an existing character
property (prefixed by ``utf8::'') or a user-defined character property,
for all the characters except the characters in the property; two
hexadecimal code points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.
</DL>
<P>

For example, to define a property that covers both the Japanese
syllabaries (hiragana and katakana), you can define
<P>



<PRE>
    sub InKana {
        return &lt;&lt;END;
    3040\t309F
    30A0\t30FF
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Imagine that the here-doc end marker is at the beginning of the line.
Now you can use <TT>&quot;\p{InKana}&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;\P{InKana}&quot;</TT>.
<P>

You could also have used the existing block property names:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub InKana {
        return &lt;&lt;'END';
    +utf8::InHiragana
    +utf8::InKatakana
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Suppose you wanted to match only the allocated characters,
not the raw block ranges: in other words, you want to remove
the non-characters:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub InKana {
        return &lt;&lt;'END';
    +utf8::InHiragana
    +utf8::InKatakana
    -utf8::IsCn
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

The negation is useful for defining (surprise!) negated classes.
<P>



<PRE>
    sub InNotKana {
        return &lt;&lt;'END';
    !utf8::InHiragana
    -utf8::InKatakana
    +utf8::IsCn
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Intersection is useful for getting the common characters matched by
two (or more) classes.
<P>



<PRE>
    sub InFooAndBar {
        return &lt;&lt;'END';
    +main::Foo
    &amp;main::Bar
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

It's important to remember not to use ``&amp;'' for the first set --- that
would be intersecting with nothing (resulting in an empty set).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>User-Defined Case Mappings</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
You can also define your own mappings to be used in the <I>lc()</I>,
<I>lcfirst()</I>, <I>uc()</I>, and <I>ucfirst()</I> (or their string-inlined versions).
The principle is similar to that of user-defined character
properties: to define subroutines in the <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> package
with names like <TT>&quot;ToLower&quot;</TT> (for <I>lc()</I> and <I>lcfirst()</I>), <TT>&quot;ToTitle&quot;</TT> (for
the first character in <I>ucfirst()</I>), and <TT>&quot;ToUpper&quot;</TT> (for <I>uc()</I>, and the
rest of the characters in <I>ucfirst()</I>).
<P>

The string returned by the subroutines needs now to be three
hexadecimal numbers separated by tabulators: start of the source
range, end of the source range, and start of the destination range.
For example:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub ToUpper {
        return &lt;&lt;END;
    0061\t0063\t0041
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

defines an <I>uc()</I> mapping that causes only the characters ``a'', ``b'', and
``c'' to be mapped to ``A'', ``B'', ``C'', all other characters will remain
unchanged.
<P>

If there is no source range to speak of, that is, the mapping is from
a single character to another single character, leave the end of the
source range empty, but the two tabulator characters are still needed.
For example:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub ToLower {
        return &lt;&lt;END;
    0041\t\t0061
    END
    }

</PRE>


<P>

defines a <I>lc()</I> mapping that causes only ``A'' to be mapped to ``a'', all
other characters will remain unchanged.
<P>

(For serious hackers only)  If you want to introspect the default
mappings, you can find the data in the directory
<TT>$Config{privlib}</TT>/<I>unicore/To/</I>.  The mapping data is returned as
the here-document, and the <TT>&quot;utf8::ToSpecFoo&quot;</TT> are special exception
mappings derived from &lt;$Config{privlib}&gt;/<I>unicore/SpecialCasing.txt</I>.
The <TT>&quot;Digit&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;Fold&quot;</TT> mappings that one can see in the directory
are not directly user-accessible, one can use either the
<TT>&quot;Unicode::UCD&quot;</TT> module, or just match case-insensitively (that's when
the <TT>&quot;Fold&quot;</TT> mapping is used).
<P>

A final note on the user-defined case mappings: they will be used
only if the scalar has been marked as having Unicode characters.
Old byte-style strings will not be affected.

        [6]  \b \B
        [7]  note that Perl does Full case-folding in matching, not Simple:
             for example U+1F88 is equivalent to U+1F00 U+03B9,
             not with 1F80.  This difference matters mainly for certain Greek
             capital letters with certain modifiers: the Full case-folding
             decomposes the letter, while the Simple case-folding would map
             it to a single character.
        [8]  should do ^ and $ also on U+000B (\v in C), FF (\f), CR (\r),
             CRLF (\r\n), NEL (U+0085), LS (U+2028), and PS (U+2029);
             should also affect &lt;&gt;, $., and script line numbers;
             should not split lines within CRLF [c] (i.e. there is no empty
             line between \r and \n)
        [9]  UTF-8/UTF-EBDDIC used in perl allows not only U+10000 to U+10FFFF
             but also beyond U+10FFFF [d]

<P>


[a] You can mimic class subtraction using lookahead.
For example, what UTS#18 might write as


<P>




<PRE>
    [{Greek}-[{UNASSIGNED}]]

</PRE>




<P>


in Perl can be written as:


<P>




<PRE>
    (?!\p{Unassigned})\p{InGreekAndCoptic}
    (?=\p{Assigned})\p{InGreekAndCoptic}

</PRE>




<P>


But in this particular example, you probably really want


<P>




<PRE>
    \p{GreekAndCoptic}

</PRE>




<P>


which will match assigned characters known to be part of the Greek script.


<P>


Also see the Unicode::Regex::Set module, it does implement the full
UTS#18 grouping, intersection, union, and removal (subtraction) syntax.


<P>


[b] '+' for union, '-' for removal (set-difference), '&amp;' for intersection
(see ``User-Defined Character Properties'')

[c] Try the <TT>&quot;:crlf&quot;</TT> layer (see PerlIO).

 Code Points            1st Byte  2nd Byte  3rd Byte  4th Byte

   U+0080..U+07FF       C2..DF    80..BF
   U+0800..U+0FFF       E0        A0..BF    80..BF
   U+1000..U+CFFF       E1..EC    80..BF    80..BF
   U+D000..U+D7FF       ED        80..9F    80..BF

   U+E000..U+FFFF       EE..EF    80..BF    80..BF
  U+10000..U+3FFFF      F0        90..BF    80..BF    80..BF
  U+40000..U+FFFFF      F1..F3    80..BF    80..BF    80..BF
 U+100000..U+10FFFF     F4        80..8F    80..BF    80..BF

</PRE>




<P>


Note the <TT>&quot;A0..BF&quot;</TT> in <TT>&quot;U+0800..U+0FFF&quot;</TT>, the <TT>&quot;80..9F&quot;</TT> in
<TT>&quot;U+D000...U+D7FF&quot;</TT>, the <TT>&quot;90..B&quot;</TT>F in <TT>&quot;U+10000..U+3FFFF&quot;</TT>, and the
<TT>&quot;80...8F&quot;</TT> in <TT>&quot;U+100000..U+10FFFF&quot;</TT>.  The ``gaps'' are caused by legal
<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> avoiding non-shortest encodings: it is technically possible to
UTF-8-encode a single code point in different ways, but that is
explicitly forbidden, and the shortest possible encoding should always
be used.  So that's what Perl does.


<P>


Another way to look at it is via bits:


<P>




<PRE>
 Code Points                    1st Byte   2nd Byte  3rd Byte  4th Byte

                    0aaaaaaa     0aaaaaaa
            00000bbbbbaaaaaa     110bbbbb  10aaaaaa
            ccccbbbbbbaaaaaa     1110cccc  10bbbbbb  10aaaaaa
  00000dddccccccbbbbbbaaaaaa     11110ddd  10cccccc  10bbbbbb  10aaaaaa

</PRE>




<P>


As you can see, the continuation bytes all begin with <TT>10</TT>, and the
leading bits of the start byte tell how many bytes the are in the
encoded character.
<DT>*<DD>
UTF-EBCDIC


<P>


Like <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> but EBCDIC-safe, in the way that <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> is ASCII-safe.
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16BE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16LE</FONT>, Surrogates, and BOMs (Byte Order Marks)


<P>


The followings items are mostly for reference and general Unicode
knowledge, Perl doesn't use these constructs internally.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT> is a 2 or 4 byte encoding.  The Unicode code points
<TT>&quot;U+0000..U+FFFF&quot;</TT> are stored in a single 16-bit unit, and the code
points <TT>&quot;U+10000..U+10FFFF&quot;</TT> in two 16-bit units.  The latter case is
using <I>surrogates</I>, the first 16-bit unit being the <I>high
surrogate</I>, and the second being the <I>low surrogate</I>.


<P>


Surrogates are code points set aside to encode the <TT>&quot;U+10000..U+10FFFF&quot;</TT>
range of Unicode code points in pairs of 16-bit units.  The <I>high
surrogates</I> are the range <TT>&quot;U+D800..U+DBFF&quot;</TT>, and the <I>low surrogates</I>
are the range <TT>&quot;U+DC00..U+DFFF&quot;</TT>.  The surrogate encoding is

If you try to generate surrogates (for example by using <I>chr()</I>), you
will get a warning if warnings are turned on, because those code
points are not valid for a Unicode character.


<P>


Because of the 16-bitness, <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT> is byte-order dependent.  <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>
itself can be used for in-memory computations, but if storage or
transfer is required either <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16BE</FONT> (big-endian) or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16LE</FONT>
(little-endian) encodings must be chosen.


<P>


This introduces another problem: what if you just know that your data
is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>, but you don't know which endianness?  Byte Order Marks, or
BOMs, are a solution to this.  A special character has been reserved
in Unicode to function as a byte order marker: the character with the
code point <TT>&quot;U+FEFF&quot;</TT> is the <FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT>.


<P>


The trick is that if you read a <FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT>, you will know the byte order,
since if it was written on a big-endian platform, you will read the
bytes <TT>&quot;0xFE 0xFF&quot;</TT>, but if it was written on a little-endian platform,
you will read the bytes <TT>&quot;0xFF 0xFE&quot;</TT>.  (And if the originating platform
was writing in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>, you will read the bytes <TT>&quot;0xEF 0xBB 0xBF&quot;</TT>.)


<P>


The way this trick works is that the character with the code point
<TT>&quot;U+FFFE&quot;</TT> is guaranteed not to be a valid Unicode character, so the
sequence of bytes <TT>&quot;0xFF 0xFE&quot;</TT> is unambiguously ``<FONT SIZE="-1">BOM</FONT>, represented in
little-endian format'' and cannot be <TT>&quot;U+FFFE&quot;</TT>, represented in big-endian
format&quot;.

Malformed <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>


<P>


Unfortunately, the specification of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> leaves some room for
interpretation of how many bytes of encoded output one should generate
from one input Unicode character.  Strictly speaking, the shortest
possible sequence of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> bytes should be generated,
because otherwise there is potential for an input buffer overflow at
the receiving end of a <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> connection.  Perl always generates the
shortest length <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>, and with warnings on Perl will warn about
non-shortest length <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> along with other malformations, such as the
surrogates, which are not real Unicode code points.
<DT>*<DD>
Regular expressions behave slightly differently between byte data and
character (Unicode) data.  For example, the ``word character'' character
class <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> will work differently depending on if data is eight-bit bytes
or Unicode.


<P>


In the first case, the set of <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> characters is either small---the
default set of alphabetic characters, digits, and the ``_''--or, if you
are using a locale (see perllocale), the <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> might contain a few
more letters according to your language and country.


<P>


In the second case, the <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> set of characters is much, much larger.
Most importantly, even in the set of the first 256 characters, it will
probably match different characters: unlike most locales, which are
specific to a language and country pair, Unicode classifies all the
characters that are letters <I>somewhere</I> as <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT>.  For example, your
locale might not think that <FONT SIZE="-1">LATIN</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">SMALL</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">LETTER</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ETH</FONT> is a letter (unless
you happen to speak Icelandic), but Unicode does.


<P>


As discussed elsewhere, Perl has one foot (two hooves?) planted in
each of two worlds: the old world of bytes and the new world of
characters, upgrading from bytes to characters when necessary.
If your legacy code does not explicitly use Unicode, no automatic
switch-over to characters should happen.  Characters shouldn't get
downgraded to bytes, either.  It is possible to accidentally mix bytes
and characters, however (see perluniintro), in which case <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> in
regular expressions might start behaving differently.  Review your
code.  Use warnings and the <TT>&quot;strict&quot;</TT> pragma.

The way Unicode is handled on <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> platforms is still
experimental.  On such platforms, references to <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoding in this

specified in Unicode Technical Report 16, unless <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> vs. <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> issues
are specifically discussed. There is no <TT>&quot;utfebcdic&quot;</TT> pragma or
``:utfebcdic'' layer; rather, ``utf8'' and ``:utf8'' are reused to mean
the platform's ``natural'' 8-bit encoding of Unicode. See perlebcdic

You can enable automatic UTF-8-ification of your standard file

<H3>When Unicode Does Not Happen</H3>

<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
While Perl does have extensive ways to input and output in Unicode,
and few other 'entry points' like the <TT>@ARGV</TT> which can be interpreted
as Unicode (<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>), there still are many places where Unicode (in some
encoding or another) could be given as arguments or received as
results, or both, but it is not.
<P>

The following are such interfaces.  For all of these interfaces Perl
currently (as of 5.8.3) simply assumes byte strings both as arguments
and results, or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> strings if the <TT>&quot;encoding&quot;</TT> pragma has been used.
<P>

One reason why Perl does not attempt to resolve the role of Unicode in
this cases is that the answers are highly dependent on the operating
system and the file system(s).  For example, whether filenames can be
in Unicode, and in exactly what kind of encoding, is not exactly a
portable concept.  Similarly for the qx and system: how well will the
'command line interface' (and which of them?) handle Unicode?

does <B>not</B> mean that there are any characters of code points greater
than 255 (or 127) in the scalar or that there are even any characters
in the scalar.  What the <TT>&quot;UTF8&quot;</TT> flag means is that the sequence of
octets in the representation of the scalar is the sequence of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>
encoded code points of the characters of a string.  The <TT>&quot;UTF8&quot;</TT> flag
being off means that each octet in this representation encodes a

<H3>Interaction with Locales</H3>

<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
Use of locales with Unicode data may lead to odd results.  Currently,
Perl attempts to attach 8-bit locale info to characters in the range
0..255, but this technique is demonstrably incorrect for locales that
use characters above that range when mapped into Unicode.  Perl's
Unicode support will also tend to run slower.  Use of locales with
Unicode is discouraged.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Problems with characters whose ordinal numbers are in the range 128 - 255 with no Locale specified</H3>

<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
Without a locale specified, unlike all other characters or code points,
these characters have very different semantics in byte semantics versus
character semantics.
In character semantics they are interpreted as Unicode code points, which means
they are viewed as Latin-1 (<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO-8859-1</FONT>).
In byte semantics, they are considered to be unassigned characters,
meaning that the only semantics they have is their
ordinal numbers, and that they are not members of various character classes.
None are considered to match <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> for example, but all match <TT>&quot;\W&quot;</TT>.
Besides these class matches,
the known operations that this affects are those that change the case,
regular expression matching while ignoring case,
and <B></B>quotemeta()<B></B>.
This can lead to unexpected results in which a string's semantics suddenly
change if a code point above 255 is appended to or removed from it,
which changes the string's semantics from byte to character or vice versa.
This behavior is scheduled to change in version 5.12, but in the meantime,
a workaround is to always call utf8::upgrade($string), or to use the
standard modules Encode or charnames.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Interaction with Extensions</H3>

<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
When Perl exchanges data with an extension, the extension should be
able to understand the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF8</FONT> flag and act accordingly. If the
extension doesn't know about the flag, it's likely that the extension
will return incorrectly-flagged data.
<P>

So if you're working with Unicode data, consult the documentation of
every module you're using if there are any issues with Unicode data
exchange. If the documentation does not talk about Unicode at all,
suspect the worst and probably look at the source to learn how the
module is implemented. Modules written completely in Perl shouldn't
cause problems. Modules that directly or indirectly access code written
in other programming languages are at risk.
<P>

For affected functions, the simple strategy to avoid data corruption is
to always make the encoding of the exchanged data explicit. Choose an
encoding that you know the extension can handle. Convert arguments passed
to the extensions to that encoding and convert results back from that
encoding. Write wrapper functions that do the conversions for you, so
you can later change the functions when the extension catches up.
<P>

To provide an example, let's say the popular Foo::Bar::escape_html
function doesn't deal with Unicode data yet. The wrapper function
would convert the argument to raw <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> and convert the result back to
Perl's internal representation like so:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub my_escape_html ($) {
      my($what) = shift;
      return unless defined $what;
      Encode::decode_utf8(Foo::Bar::escape_html(Encode::encode_utf8($what)));
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Sometimes, when the extension does not convert data but just stores
and retrieves them, you will be in a position to use the otherwise
dangerous <I>Encode::_utf8_on()</I> function. Let's say the popular
<TT>&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</TT> extension, written in C, provides a <TT>&quot;param&quot;</TT> method that
lets you store and retrieve data according to these prototypes:
<P>



<PRE>
    $self-&gt;param($name, $value);            # set a scalar
    $value = $self-&gt;param($name);           # retrieve a scalar

</PRE>


<P>

If it does not yet provide support for any encoding, one could write a
derived class with such a <TT>&quot;param&quot;</TT> method:
<P>



<PRE>
    sub param {
      my($self,$name,$value) = @_;
      utf8::upgrade($name);     # make sure it is UTF-8 encoded
      if (defined $value) {
        utf8::upgrade($value);  # make sure it is UTF-8 encoded
        return $self-&gt;SUPER::param($name,$value);
      } else {
        my $ret = $self-&gt;SUPER::param($name);
        Encode::_utf8_on($ret); # we know, it is UTF-8 encoded
        return $ret;
      }
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Some extensions provide filters on data entry/exit points, such as
DB_File::filter_store_key and family. Look out for such filters in
the documentation of your extensions, they can make the transition to
Unicode data much easier.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Speed</H3>

<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
Some functions are slower when working on <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoded strings than
on byte encoded strings.  All functions that need to hop over
characters such as <I>length()</I>, <I>substr()</I> or <I>index()</I>, or matching regular
expressions can work <B>much</B> faster when the underlying data are
byte-encoded.
<P>

In Perl 5.8.0 the slowness was often quite spectacular; in Perl 5.8.1
a caching scheme was introduced which will hopefully make the slowness
somewhat less spectacular, at least for some operations.  In general,
operations with <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoded strings are still slower. As an example,
the Unicode properties (character classes) like <TT>&quot;\p{Nd}&quot;</TT> are known to
be quite a bit slower (5-20 times) than their simpler counterparts
like <TT>&quot;\d&quot;</TT> (then again, there 268 Unicode characters matching <TT>&quot;Nd&quot;</TT>
compared with the 10 <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> characters matching <TT>&quot;d&quot;</TT>).
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Possible problems on <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> platforms</H3>

<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
In earlier versions, when byte and character data were concatenated,
the new string was sometimes created by
decoding the byte strings as <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>ISO</I></FONT><I> 8859-1 (Latin-1)</I>, even if the
old Unicode string used <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT>.

<H3>Porting code from perl-5.6.X</H3>

<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
Perl 5.8 has a different Unicode model from 5.6. In 5.6 the programmer
was required to use the <TT>&quot;utf8&quot;</TT> pragma to declare that a given scope
expected to deal with Unicode data and had to make sure that only
Unicode data were reaching that scope. If you have code that is
working with 5.6, you will need some of the following adjustments to
your code. The examples are written such that the code will continue
to work under 5.6, so you should be safe to try them out.

Scalars that contain only <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> and are marked as <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> are sometimes
a drag to your program. If you recognize such a situation, just remove
the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF8</FONT> flag:
