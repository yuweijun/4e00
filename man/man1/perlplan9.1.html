<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for Perl
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
These are a few notes describing features peculiar to
Plan 9 Perl. As such, it is not intended to be a replacement
for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation (which is both 
copious and excellent). If you have any questions to 
which you can't find answers in these man pages, contact 
Luther Huffman at <A HREF="mailto:lutherh@stratcom.com">lutherh@stratcom.com</A> and we'll try to 
answer them.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Invoking Perl</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Perl is invoked from the command line as described in 
perl. Most perl scripts, however, do have a first line 
such as ``#!/usr/local/bin/perl''. This is known as a shebang 
(shell-bang) statement and tells the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> shell where to find 
the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl this statement should be 
``#!/bin/perl'' if you wish to be able to directly invoke the 
script by its name.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively,&nbsp;you&nbsp;may&nbsp;invoke&nbsp;perl&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;command&nbsp;``Perl''
instead of ``perl''. This will produce Acme-friendly error
messages of the form ``filename:18''.
<P>

Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are 
self-configuring and are able to correctly create their own 
shebang path from config information located in Plan 9 
Perl. These you won't need to be worried about.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What's in Plan 9 Perl</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Although Plan 9 Perl currently only  provides static 
loading, it is built with a number of useful extensions. 
These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>. Expect 
to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What's not in Plan 9 Perl</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
As mentioned previously, dynamic loading isn't currently 
available nor is MakeMaker. Both are high-priority items.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Perl5 Functions not currently supported in Plan 9 Perl</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Some, such as <TT>&quot;chown&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;umask&quot;</TT> aren't provided 
because the concept does not exist within Plan 9. Others,
such as some of the socket-related functions, simply
haven't been written yet. Many in the latter category 
may be supported in the future.
<P>

The functions not currently implemented include:
<P>



<PRE>
    chown, chroot, dbmclose, dbmopen, getsockopt, 
    setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, 
    getnetbyaddr, getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, 
    sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent, 
    endservent, endnetent, endprotoent, umask

</PRE>


<P>

There may be several other functions that have undefined 
behavior so this list shouldn't be considered complete.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Signals in Plan 9 Perl</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
For compatibility with perl scripts written for the Unix 
environment, Plan 9 Perl uses the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> signal emulation
provided in Plan 9's <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> Environment (<FONT SIZE="-1">APE</FONT>). Signal stacking
isn't supported. The signals provided are:
<P>



<PRE>
    SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGABRT,
    SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, 
    SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT,
    SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMPILING AND INSTALLING PERL ON PLAN 9</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">WELCOME</FONT> to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!
<P>



<PRE>
   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near
future.To install this software:

</PRE>


<P>

1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running the
plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory).
Note: the setup routine assumes that you haven't dearchived these
files into /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete
the copy of the source you originally detarred, as source code has now
been installed in /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl
binaries for all architectures, run ``setup.rc -a''.
<P>

2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build system
software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version
appropriately) run:
<P>



<PRE>
        mk install

</PRE>


<P>

If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020,
mips, sparc and 386) run:
<P>



<PRE>
        mk installall

</PRE>


<P>

3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl
bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> machine takes roughly 30
minutes to build the distribution from scratch.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Installing Perl Documentation on Plan 9</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of
documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that come with
Plan 9, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately)
run:
<P>



<PRE>
        mk man

</PRE>


<P>

To begin your reading, start with:
<P>



<PRE>
        man perl

</PRE>


<P>

This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man
pages that may interest you.
<P>

(Note: ``mk man'' may produce some extraneous noise. Fear not.)
