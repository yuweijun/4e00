<H2>NAME</H2>

perltrap - Perl traps for the unwary
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
The biggest trap of all is forgetting to <TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT> or use the <B>-w</B>
switch; see perllexwarn and perlrun. The second biggest trap is not
making your entire program runnable under <TT>&quot;use strict&quot;</TT>.  The third biggest
trap is not reading the list of changes in this version of Perl; see
perldelta.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Awk Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Accustomed <B>awk</B> users should take special note of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
A Perl program executes only once, not once for each input line.  You can
do an implicit loop with <TT>&quot;-n&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;-p&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
The English module, loaded via


<P>




<PRE>
    use English;

</PRE>




<P>


allows you to refer to special variables (like <TT>$/</TT>) with names (like
<TT>$RS</TT>), as though they were in <B>awk</B>; see perlvar for details.
<DT>*<DD>
Semicolons are required after all simple statements in Perl (except
at the end of a block).  Newline is not a statement delimiter.
<DT>*<DD>
Curly brackets are required on <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>s and <TT>&quot;while&quot;</TT>s.
<DT>*<DD>
Variables begin with ``$'', ``@'' or ``%'' in Perl.
<DT>*<DD>
Arrays index from 0.  Likewise string positions in <I>substr()</I> and
<I>index()</I>.
<DT>*<DD>
You have to decide whether your array has numeric or string indices.
<DT>*<DD>
Hash values do not spring into existence upon mere reference.
<DT>*<DD>
You have to decide whether you want to use string or numeric
comparisons.
<DT>*<DD>
Reading an input line does not split it for you.  You get to split it
to an array yourself.  And the <I>split()</I> operator has different
arguments than <B>awk</B>'s.
<DT>*<DD>
The current input line is normally in <TT>$_</TT>, not <TT>$0</TT>.  It generally does
not have the newline stripped.  ($0 is the name of the program
executed.)  See perlvar.
<DT>*<DD>
$&lt;<I>digit</I>&gt; does not refer to fields---it refers to substrings matched
by the last match pattern.
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>print()</I> statement does not add field and record separators unless
you set <TT>$,</TT> and <TT>&quot;$\&quot;</TT>.  You can set <TT>$OFS</TT> and <TT>$ORS</TT> if you're using
the English module.
<DT>*<DD>
You must open your files before you print to them.
<DT>*<DD>
The range operator is ``..'', not comma.  The comma operator works as in
C.
<DT>*<DD>
The match operator is ``=~'', not ``~''.  (``~'' is the one's complement
operator, as in C.)
<DT>*<DD>
The exponentiation operator is ``**'', not ``^''.  ``^'' is the <FONT SIZE="-1">XOR</FONT>
operator, as in C.  (You know, one could get the feeling that <B>awk</B> is
basically incompatible with C.)
<DT>*<DD>
The concatenation operator is ``.'', not the null string.  (Using the
null string would render <TT>&quot;/pat/ /pat/&quot;</TT> unparsable, because the third slash
would be interpreted as a division operator---the tokenizer is in fact
slightly context sensitive for operators like ``/'', ``?'', and ``&gt;''.
And in fact, ``.'' itself can be the beginning of a number.)
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;next&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;exit&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;continue&quot;</TT> keywords work differently.
<DT>*<DD>
The following variables work differently:


<P>




<PRE>
      Awk       Perl
      ARGC      scalar @ARGV (compare with $#ARGV)
      ARGV[0]   $0
      FILENAME  $ARGV
      FNR       $. - something
      FS        (whatever you like)
      NF        $#Fld, or some such
      NR        $.
      OFMT      $#
      OFS       $,
      ORS       $\
      RLENGTH   length($&amp;)
      RS        $/
      RSTART    length($`)
      SUBSEP    $;

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
You cannot set <TT>$RS</TT> to a pattern, only a string.
<DT>*<DD>
When in doubt, run the <B>awk</B> construct through <B>a2p</B> and see what it
gives you.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Cerebral C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programmers should take note of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Curly brackets are required on <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>'s and <TT>&quot;while&quot;</TT>'s.
<DT>*<DD>
You must use <TT>&quot;elsif&quot;</TT> rather than <TT>&quot;else if&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;break&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;continue&quot;</TT> keywords from C become in Perl <TT>&quot;last&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;next&quot;</TT>, respectively.  Unlike in C, these do <I>not</I> work within a
<TT>&quot;do { } while&quot;</TT> construct.  See ``Loop Control'' in perlsyn.
<DT>*<DD>
The switch statement is called <TT>&quot;given/when&quot;</TT> and only available in
perl 5.10 or newer. See ``Switch statements'' in perlsyn.
<DT>*<DD>
Variables begin with ``$'', ``@'' or ``%'' in Perl.
<DT>*<DD>
Comments begin with ``#'', not ``/*'' or ``//''.  Perl may interpret C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
comments as division operators, unterminated regular expressions or
the defined-or operator.
<DT>*<DD>
You can't take the address of anything, although a similar operator
in Perl is the backslash, which creates a reference.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;ARGV&quot;</TT> must be capitalized.  <TT>$ARGV[0]</TT> is C's <TT>&quot;argv[1]&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;argv[0]&quot;</TT>
ends up in <TT>$0</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
System calls such as <I>link()</I>, <I>unlink()</I>, <I>rename()</I>, etc. return nonzero for
success, not 0. (<I>system()</I>, however, returns zero for success.)
<DT>*<DD>
Signal handlers deal with signal names, not numbers.  Use <TT>&quot;kill -l&quot;</TT>
to find their names on your system.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Sed Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
Seasoned <B>sed</B> programmers should take note of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
A Perl program executes only once, not once for each input line.  You can
do an implicit loop with <TT>&quot;-n&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;-p&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Backreferences in substitutions use ``$'' rather than ``\''.
<DT>*<DD>
The pattern matching metacharacters ``('', ``)'', and ``|'' do not have backslashes
in front.
<DT>*<DD>
The range operator is <TT>&quot;...&quot;</TT>, rather than comma.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Shell Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Sharp shell programmers should take note of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The backtick operator does variable interpolation without regard to
the presence of single quotes in the command.
<DT>*<DD>
The backtick operator does no translation of the return value, unlike <B>csh</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
Shells (especially <B>csh</B>) do several levels of substitution on each
command line.  Perl does substitution in only certain constructs
such as double quotes, backticks, angle brackets, and search patterns.
<DT>*<DD>
Shells interpret scripts a little bit at a time.  Perl compiles the
entire program before executing it (except for <TT>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</TT> blocks, which
execute at compile time).
<DT>*<DD>
The arguments are available via <TT>@ARGV</TT>, not <TT>$1</TT>, <TT>$2</TT>, etc.
<DT>*<DD>
The environment is not automatically made available as separate scalar
variables.
<DT>*<DD>
The shell's <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> uses ``='', ``!='', ``&lt;'' etc for string comparisons and ``-eq'',
``-ne'', ``-lt'' etc for numeric comparisons. This is the reverse of Perl, which
uses <TT>&quot;eq&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;ne&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;lt&quot;</TT> for string comparisons, and <TT>&quot;==&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;!=&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;&lt;&quot;</TT> etc
for numeric comparisons.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Perl Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Practicing Perl Programmers should take note of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Remember that many operations behave differently in a list
context than they do in a scalar one.  See perldata for details.
<DT>*<DD>
Avoid barewords if you can, especially all lowercase ones.
You can't tell by just looking at it whether a bareword is
a function or a string.  By using quotes on strings and
parentheses on function calls, you won't ever get them confused.
<DT>*<DD>
You cannot discern from mere inspection which builtins
are unary operators (like <I>chop()</I> and <I>chdir()</I>)
and which are list operators (like <I>print()</I> and <I>unlink()</I>).
(Unless prototyped, user-defined subroutines can <B>only</B> be list
operators, never unary ones.)  See perlop and perlsub.
<DT>*<DD>
People have a hard time remembering that some functions
default to <TT>$_</TT>, or <TT>@ARGV</TT>, or whatever, but that others which
you might expect to do not.
<DT>*<DD>
The &lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">FH</FONT>&gt; construct is not the name of the filehandle, it is a readline
operation on that handle.  The data read is assigned to <TT>$_</TT> only if the
file read is the sole condition in a while loop:


<P>




<PRE>
    while (&lt;FH&gt;)      { }
    while (defined($_ = &lt;FH&gt;)) { }..
    &lt;FH&gt;;  # data discarded!

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Remember not to use <TT>&quot;=&quot;</TT> when you need <TT>&quot;=~&quot;</TT>;
these two constructs are quite different:


<P>




<PRE>
    $x =  /foo/;
    $x =~ /foo/;

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;do {}&quot;</TT> construct isn't a real loop that you can use
loop control on.
<DT>*<DD>
Use <TT>&quot;my()&quot;</TT> for local variables whenever you can get away with
it (but see perlform for where you can't).
Using <TT>&quot;local()&quot;</TT> actually gives a local value to a global
variable, which leaves you open to unforeseen side-effects
of dynamic scoping.
<DT>*<DD>
If you localize an exported variable in a module, its exported value will
not change.  The local name becomes an alias to a new value but the
external name is still an alias for the original.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Perl4 to Perl5 Traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
Practicing Perl4 Programmers should take note of the following
Perl4-to-Perl5 specific traps.
<P>

They're crudely ordered according to the following list:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Anything that's been fixed as a perl4 bug, removed as a perl4 feature
or deprecated as a perl4 feature with the intent to encourage usage of
some other perl5 feature.
<DT>Parsing Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Traps that appear to stem from the new parser.
<DT>Numerical Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Traps having to do with numerical or mathematical operators.
<DT>General data type traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
Traps related to the precedence of parsing, evaluation, and execution of
code.
<DT>General Regular Expression Traps using s///, etc.<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
Traps related to the use of pattern matching.
<DT>Subroutine, Signal, Sorting Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
Traps related to the use of signals and signal handlers, general subroutines,
and sorting, along with sorting subroutines.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
OS-specific traps.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">DBM</FONT> Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
Traps specific to the use of <TT>&quot;dbmopen()&quot;</TT>, and specific dbm implementations.
<DT>Unclassified Traps<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
Everything else.
</DL>
<P>

If you find an example of a conversion trap that is not listed here,
please submit it to &lt;<I><A HREF="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</A></I>&gt; for inclusion.
Also note that at least some of these can be caught with the
<TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT> pragma or the <B>-w</B> switch.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
Anything that has been discontinued, deprecated, or fixed as
a bug from perl4.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Symbols starting with ``_'' no longer forced into main


<P>


Symbols starting with ``_'' are no longer forced into package main, except
for <TT>$_</TT> itself (and <TT>@_</TT>, etc.).


<P>




<PRE>
    package test;
    $_legacy = 1;

    package main;
    print &quot;\$_legacy is &quot;,$_legacy,&quot;\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: $_legacy is 1
    # perl5 prints: $_legacy is

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Double-colon valid package separator in variable name


<P>


Double-colon is now a valid package separator in a variable name.  Thus these
behave differently in perl4 vs. perl5, because the packages don't exist.


<P>




<PRE>
    $a=1;$b=2;$c=3;$var=4;
    print &quot;$a::$b::$c &quot;;
    print &quot;$var::abc::xyz\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: 1::2::3 4::abc::xyz
    # perl5 prints: 3

</PRE>




<P>


Given that <TT>&quot;::&quot;</TT> is now the preferred package delimiter, it is debatable
whether this should be classed as a bug or not.
(The older package delimiter, ' ,is used here)


<P>




<PRE>
    $x = 10;
    print &quot;x=${'x}\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: x=10
    # perl5 prints: Can't find string terminator &quot;'&quot; anywhere before EOF

</PRE>




<P>


You can avoid this problem, and remain compatible with perl4, if you
always explicitly include the package name:


<P>




<PRE>
    $x = 10;
    print &quot;x=${main'x}\n&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


Also see precedence traps, for parsing <TT>$:</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
2nd and 3rd args to <TT>&quot;splice()&quot;</TT> are now in scalar context


<P>


The second and third arguments of <TT>&quot;splice()&quot;</TT> are now evaluated in scalar
context (as the Camel says) rather than list context.


<P>




<PRE>
    sub sub1{return(0,2) }          # return a 2-element list
    sub sub2{ return(1,2,3)}        # return a 3-element list
    @a1 = (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;);
    @a2 = splice(@a1,&amp;sub1,&amp;sub2);
    print join(' ',@a2),&quot;\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: a b
    # perl5 prints: c d e

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Can't do <TT>&quot;goto&quot;</TT> into a block that is optimized away


<P>


You can't do a <TT>&quot;goto&quot;</TT> into a block that is optimized away.  Darn.


<P>




<PRE>
    goto marker1;

    <A HREF="/man/index.html?1+for">for</A>(1){
    marker1:
        print &quot;Here I is!\n&quot;;
    }

    # perl4 prints: Here I is!
    # perl5 errors: Can't &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Can't use whitespace as variable name or quote delimiter


<P>


It is no longer syntactically legal to use whitespace as the name
of a variable, or as a delimiter for any kind of quote construct.
Double darn.


<P>




<PRE>
    $a = (&quot;foo bar&quot;);
    $b = q baz;
    print &quot;a is $a, b is $b\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: a is foo bar, b is baz
    # perl5 errors: Bareword found where operator expected

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;while/if BLOCK BLOCK&quot;</TT> gone


<P>


The archaic while/if <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT> syntax is no longer supported.


<P>




<PRE>
    if { 1 } {
        print &quot;True!&quot;;
    }
    else {
        print &quot;False!&quot;;
    }

    # perl4 prints: True!
    # perl5 errors: syntax error at test.pl line 1, near &quot;if {&quot;

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;**&quot;</TT> binds tighter than unary minus


<P>


The <TT>&quot;**&quot;</TT> operator now binds more tightly than unary minus.
It was documented to work this way before, but didn't.


<P>




<PRE>
    print -4**2,&quot;\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: 16
    # perl5 prints: -16

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;foreach&quot;</TT> changed when iterating over a list


<P>


The meaning of <TT>&quot;foreach{}&quot;</TT> has changed slightly when it is iterating over a
list which is not an array.  This used to assign the list to a
temporary array, but no longer does so (for efficiency).  This means
that you'll now be iterating over the actual values, not over copies of
the values.  Modifications to the loop variable can change the original
values.


<P>




<PRE>
    @list = ('ab','abc','bcd','def');
    foreach $var (grep(/ab/,@list)){
        $var = 1;
    }
    print (join(':',@list));

    # perl4 prints: ab:abc:bcd:def
    # perl5 prints: 1:1:bcd:def

</PRE>




<P>


To retain Perl4 semantics you need to assign your list
explicitly to a temporary array and then iterate over that.  For
example, you might need to change


<P>




<PRE>
    foreach $var (grep(/ab/,@list)){

</PRE>




<P>


to


<P>




<PRE>
    foreach $var (@tmp = grep(/ab/,@list)){

</PRE>




<P>


Otherwise changing <TT>$var</TT> will clobber the values of <TT>@list</TT>.  (This most often
happens when you use <TT>$_</TT> for the loop variable, and call subroutines in
the loop that don't properly localize <TT>$_</TT>.)
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;split&quot;</TT> with no args behavior changed


<P>


<TT>&quot;split&quot;</TT> with no arguments now behaves like <TT>&quot;split ' '&quot;</TT> (which doesn't
return an initial null field if <TT>$_</TT> starts with whitespace), it used to
behave like <TT>&quot;split /\s+/&quot;</TT> (which does).


<P>




<PRE>
    $_ = ' hi mom';
    print join(':', split);

    # perl4 prints: :hi:mom
    # perl5 prints: hi:mom

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<B>-e</B> behavior fixed


<P>


Perl 4 would ignore any text which was attached to an <B>-e</B> switch,
always taking the code snippet from the following arg.  Additionally, it
would silently accept an <B>-e</B> switch without a following arg.  Both of
these behaviors have been fixed.


<P>




<PRE>
    perl -e'print &quot;attached to -e&quot;' 'print &quot;separate arg&quot;'

    # perl4 prints: separate arg
    # perl5 prints: attached to -e

    perl -e

    # perl4 prints:
    # perl5 dies: No code specified for -e.

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;push&quot;</TT> returns number of elements in resulting list


<P>


In Perl 4 the return value of <TT>&quot;push&quot;</TT> was undocumented, but it was
actually the last value being pushed onto the target list.  In Perl 5
the return value of <TT>&quot;push&quot;</TT> is documented, but has changed, it is the
number of elements in the resulting list.


<P>




<PRE>
    @x = ('existing');
    print push(@x, 'first new', 'second new');

    # perl4 prints: second new
    # perl5 prints: 3

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Some error messages differ


<P>


Some error messages will be different.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;split()&quot;</TT> honors subroutine args


<P>


In Perl 4, if in list context the delimiters to the first argument of
<TT>&quot;split()&quot;</TT> were <TT>&quot;??&quot;</TT>, the result would be placed in <TT>@_</TT> as well as
being returned.   Perl 5 has more respect for your subroutine arguments.
<DT>*<DD>
Bugs removed


<P>


Some bugs may have been inadvertently removed.  :-)

    print &quot;${#a}&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: 2
    # perl5 fails with syntax error

<DT>*<DD>
Perl guesses on <TT>&quot;map&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;grep&quot;</TT> followed by <TT>&quot;{&quot;</TT> if it starts <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT> or hash ref


<P>


When perl sees <TT>&quot;map {&quot;</TT> (or <TT>&quot;grep {&quot;</TT>), it has to guess whether the <TT>&quot;{&quot;</TT>
starts a <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT> or a hash reference. If it guesses wrong, it will report
a syntax error near the <TT>&quot;}&quot;</TT> and the missing (or unexpected) comma.


<P>


Use unary <TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT> before <TT>&quot;{&quot;</TT> on a hash reference, and unary <TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT> applied
to the first thing in a <FONT SIZE="-1">BLOCK</FONT> (after <TT>&quot;{&quot;</TT>), for perl to guess right all
the time. (See ``map'' in perlfunc.)

Formatted output and significant digits

Formatted output and significant digits.  In general, Perl 5
tries to be more precise.  For example, on a Solaris Sparc:


<P>

<P>


Notice how the first result looks better in Perl 5.

Your results may vary, since your floating point formatting routines
and even floating point format may be slightly different.

Auto-increment operator over signed int limit deleted

This specific item has been deleted.  It demonstrated how the auto-increment
operator would not catch when a number went over the signed int limit.  Fixed

Assignment of return values from numeric equality tests doesn't work

Bitwise string ops


<P>


When bitwise operators which can operate upon either numbers or
strings (<TT>&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;</TT>) are given only strings as arguments, perl4 would
treat the operands as bitstrings so long as the program contained a call
to the <TT>&quot;vec()&quot;</TT> function. perl5 treats the string operands as bitstrings.
(See ``Bitwise String Operators'' in perlop for more details.)

Assigning <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> to glob

Assigning <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> to a glob has no effect in Perl 5.   In Perl 4
it undefines the associated scalar (but may have other side effects
including SEGVs). Perl 5 will also warn if <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> is assigned to a
typeglob. (Note that assigning <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> to a typeglob is different
than calling the <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> function on a typeglob (<TT>&quot;undef *foo&quot;</TT>), which
has quite a few effects.

    $x = (1, 2, @y);

<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;sprintf()&quot;</TT> prototyped as <TT>&quot;($;@)&quot;</TT>


<P>


<TT>&quot;sprintf()&quot;</TT> is prototyped as ($;@), so its first argument is given scalar
context. Thus, if passed an array, it will probably not do what you want,
unlike Perl 4:


<P>




<PRE>
    @z = ('%s%s', 'foo', 'bar');
    $x = sprintf(@z);
    print $x;

    # perl4 prints: foobar

<FONT SIZE="-1">LHS</FONT> vs. <FONT SIZE="-1">RHS</FONT> of any assignment operator


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">LHS</FONT> vs. <FONT SIZE="-1">RHS</FONT> of any assignment operator.  <FONT SIZE="-1">LHS</FONT> is evaluated first
in perl4, second in perl5; this can affect the relationship
between side-effects in sub-expressions.


<P>




<PRE>
    @arr = ( 'left', 'right' );
    $a{shift @arr} = shift @arr;
    print join( ' ', keys %a );

    # perl4 prints: left
    # perl5 prints: right

<DT>*<DD>
Semantic errors introduced due to precedence


<P>


These are now semantic errors because of precedence:


<P>




<PRE>
    @list = (1,2,3,4,5);
    %map = (&quot;a&quot;,1,&quot;b&quot;,2,&quot;c&quot;,3,&quot;d&quot;,4);
    $n = shift @list + 2;   # first item in list plus 2
    print &quot;n is $n, &quot;;
    $m = keys %map + 2;     # number of items in hash plus 2
    print &quot;m is $m\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: n is 3, m is 6
    # perl5 errors and fails to compile

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Precedence of assignment operators same as the precedence of assignment


<P>


The precedence of assignment operators is now the same as the precedence
of assignment.  Perl 4 mistakenly gave them the precedence of the associated
operator.  So you now must parenthesize them in expressions like


<P>




<PRE>
    /foo/ ? ($a += 2) : ($a -= 2);

</PRE>




<P>


Otherwise


<P>




<PRE>
    /foo/ ? $a += 2 : $a -= 2

</PRE>




<P>


would be erroneously parsed as


<P>




<PRE>
    (/foo/ ? $a += 2 : $a) -= 2;

</PRE>




<P>


On the other hand,


<P>




<PRE>
    $a += /foo/ ? 1 : 2;

</PRE>




<P>


now works as a C programmer would expect.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;open&quot;</TT> requires parentheses around filehandle


<P>




<PRE>
    open FOO || die;

</PRE>




<P>


is now incorrect.  You need parentheses around the filehandle.
Otherwise, perl5 leaves the statement as its default precedence:


<P>




<PRE>
    open(FOO || die);

    # perl4 opens or dies
    # perl5 opens FOO, dying only if 'FOO' is false, i.e. never

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>$:</TT> precedence over <TT>$::</TT> gone


<P>


perl4 gives the special variable, <TT>$:</TT> precedence, where perl5
treats <TT>$::</TT> as main <TT>&quot;package&quot;</TT>


<P>




<PRE>
    $a = &quot;x&quot;; print &quot;$::a&quot;;

    # perl 4 prints: -:a
    # perl 5 prints: x

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Precedence of file test operators documented


<P>


perl4 had buggy precedence for the file test operators vis-a-vis
the assignment operators.  Thus, although the precedence table
for perl4 leads one to believe <TT>&quot;-e $foo .= &quot;q&quot;&quot;</TT> should parse as
<TT>&quot;((-e $foo) .= &quot;q&quot;)&quot;</TT>, it actually parses as <TT>&quot;(-e ($foo .= &quot;q&quot;))&quot;</TT>.
In perl5, the precedence is as documented.


<P>




<PRE>
    -e $foo .= &quot;q&quot;

    # perl4 prints: no output
    # perl5 prints: Can't modify -e in concatenation

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;keys&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;each&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;values&quot;</TT> are regular named unary operators


<P>


In perl4, <I>keys()</I>, <I>each()</I> and <I>values()</I> were special high-precedence operators
that operated on a single hash, but in perl5, they are regular named unary
operators.  As documented, named unary operators have lower precedence
than the arithmetic and concatenation operators <TT>&quot;+ - .&quot;</TT>, but the perl4
variants of these operators actually bind tighter than <TT>&quot;+ - .&quot;</TT>.
Thus, for:


<P>




<PRE>
    %foo = 1..10;
    print keys %foo - 1

    # perl4 prints: 4
    # perl5 prints: Type of arg 1 to keys must be hash (not subtraction)

The perl4 behavior was probably more useful, if less consistent.

Currently, if you use the <TT>&quot;m//o&quot;</TT> qualifier on a regular expression

    print $bad-&gt;('foo stuff bar') ? &quot;not ok\n&quot; : &quot;ok\n&quot;;

For most builds of Perl5, this will print:

within  the signal handler function, each time a signal was handled with
perl4.  With perl5, the reset is now done correctly.  Any code relying
on the handler _not_ being reset will have to be reworked.


<P>


Since version 5.002, Perl uses <I>sigaction()</I> under SysV.


<P>




<PRE>
    sub gotit {
        print &quot;Got @_... &quot;;
    }
    $SIG{'INT'} = 'gotit';

    $| = 1;
    $pid = fork;
    if ($pid) {
        kill('INT', $pid);
        <A HREF="/man/index.html?1+sleep">sleep</A>(1);
        kill('INT', $pid);
    } else {
        while (1) {sleep(10);}
    }

    # perl4 (HPUX) prints: Got INT...
    # perl5 (HPUX) prints: Got INT... Got INT...

SysV <TT>&quot;seek()&quot;</TT> appends correctly


<P>


Under SysV OSes, <TT>&quot;seek()&quot;</TT> on a file opened to append <TT>&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</TT> now does
the right thing w.r.t. the <I>fopen()</I> manpage. e.g., - When a file is opened
for append,  it  is  impossible to overwrite information already in
the file.


<P>




<PRE>
    open(TEST,&quot;&gt;&gt;seek.test&quot;);
    $start = tell TEST;
    foreach(1 .. 9){
        print TEST &quot;$_ &quot;;
    }
    $end = tell TEST;
    seek(TEST,$start,0);
    print TEST &quot;18 characters here&quot;;

    # perl4 (solaris) seek.test has: 18 characters here
    # perl5 (solaris) seek.test has: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 18 characters here

<H3>Interpolation Traps</H3>

<TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT> always interpolates an array in double-quotish strings


<P>


@ now always interpolates an array in double-quotish strings.


<P>




<PRE>
    print &quot;To: <A HREF="mailto:someone@somewhere.com">someone@somewhere.com</A>\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: To:<A HREF="mailto:someone@somewhere.com">someone@somewhere.com</A>
    # perl &lt; 5.6.1, error : In string, @somewhere now must be written as \@somewhere
    # perl &gt;= 5.6.1, warning : Possible unintended interpolation of @somewhere in string

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Double-quoted strings may no longer end with an unescaped $


<P>


Double-quoted strings may no longer end with an unescaped $.


<P>




<PRE>
    $foo = &quot;foo$&quot;;
    print &quot;foo is $foo\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: foo is foo$
    # perl5 errors: Final $ should be \$ or $name

</PRE>




<P>


Note: perl5 <FONT SIZE="-1">DOES</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT> error on the terminating @ in <TT>$bar</TT>
<DT>*<DD>
Arbitrary expressions are evaluated inside braces within double quotes


<P>


Perl now sometimes evaluates arbitrary expressions inside braces that occur
within double quotes (usually when the opening brace is preceded by <TT>&quot;$&quot;</TT>
or <TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT>).


<P>




<PRE>
    @www = &quot;buz&quot;;
    $foo = &quot;foo&quot;;
    $bar = &quot;bar&quot;;
    sub foo { return &quot;bar&quot; };
    print &quot;|@{w.w.w}|${main'foo}|&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: |@{w.w.w}|foo|
    # perl5 prints: |buz|bar|

</PRE>




<P>


Note that you can <TT>&quot;use strict;&quot;</TT> to ward off such trappiness under perl5.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>$$x</TT> now tries to dereference <TT>$x</TT>


<P>


The construct ``this is $$x'' used to interpolate the pid at that point, but
now tries to dereference <TT>$x</TT>.  <TT>$$</TT> by itself still works fine, however.


<P>




<PRE>
    $s = &quot;a reference&quot;;
    $x = *s;
    print &quot;this is $$x\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: this is XXXx   (XXX is the current pid)
    # perl5 prints: this is a reference

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Creation of hashes on the fly with <TT>&quot;eval &quot;EXPR&quot;&quot;</TT> requires protection


<P>


Creation of hashes on the fly with <TT>&quot;eval &quot;EXPR&quot;&quot;</TT> now requires either both
<TT>&quot;$&quot;</TT>'s to be protected in the specification of the hash name, or both curlies
to be protected.  If both curlies are protected, the result will be compatible
with perl4 and perl5.  This is a very common practice, and should be changed
to use the block form of <TT>&quot;eval{}&quot;</TT>  if possible.


<P>




<PRE>
    $hashname = &quot;foobar&quot;;
    $key = &quot;baz&quot;;
    $value = 1234;
    eval &quot;\$$hashname{'$key'} = q|$value|&quot;;
    (defined($foobar{'baz'})) ?  (print &quot;Yup&quot;) : (print &quot;Nope&quot;);

    # perl4 prints: Yup
    # perl5 prints: Nope

</PRE>




<P>


Changing


<P>




<PRE>
    eval &quot;\$$hashname{'$key'} = q|$value|&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


to


<P>




<PRE>
    eval &quot;\$\$hashname{'$key'} = q|$value|&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


causes the following result:


<P>




<PRE>
    # perl4 prints: Nope
    # perl5 prints: Yup

</PRE>




<P>


or, changing to


<P>




<PRE>
    eval &quot;\$$hashname\{'$key'\} = q|$value|&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


causes the following result:


<P>




<PRE>
    # perl4 prints: Yup
    # perl5 prints: Yup
    # and is compatible for both versions

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Bugs in earlier perl versions


<P>


perl4 programs which unconsciously rely on the bugs in earlier perl versions.


<P>




<PRE>
    perl -e '$bar=q/not/; print &quot;This is $foo{$bar} perl5&quot;'

    # perl4 prints: This is not perl5
    # perl5 prints: This is perl5

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Array and hash brackets during interpolation


<P>


You also have to be careful about array and hash brackets during
interpolation.


<P>




<PRE>
    print &quot;$foo[&quot;

    perl 4 prints: [
    perl 5 prints: syntax error

    print &quot;$foo{&quot;

    perl 4 prints: {
    perl 5 prints: syntax error

</PRE>




<P>


Perl 5 is expecting to find an index or key name following the respective
brackets, as well as an ending bracket of the appropriate type.  In order
to mimic the behavior of Perl 4, you must escape the bracket like so.


<P>




<PRE>
    print &quot;$foo\[&quot;;
    print &quot;$foo\{&quot;;

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Interpolation of <TT>&quot;\$$foo{bar}&quot;</TT>


<P>


Similarly, watch out for: <TT>&quot;\$$foo{bar}&quot;</TT>


<P>




<PRE>
    $foo = &quot;baz&quot;;
    print &quot;\$$foo{bar}\n&quot;;

    # perl4 prints: $baz{bar}
    # perl5 prints: $

</PRE>




<P>


Perl 5 is looking for <TT>$foo{bar}</TT> which doesn't exist, but perl 4 is
happy just to expand <TT>$foo</TT> to ``baz'' by itself.  Watch out for this
especially in <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT>'s.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;qq()&quot;</TT> string passed to <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT> will not find string terminator


<P>


<TT>&quot;qq()&quot;</TT> string passed to <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT>


<P>




<PRE>
    eval qq(
        foreach \$y (keys %\$x\) {
            \$count++;
        }
    );

    # perl4 runs this ok
    # perl5 prints: Can't find string terminator &quot;)&quot;
