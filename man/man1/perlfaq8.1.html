perlfaq8 - System Interaction
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This section of the Perl <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> covers questions involving operating
system interaction.  Topics include interprocess communication (<FONT SIZE="-1">IPC</FONT>),
control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.
<P>

Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, perlvms, perlplan9, ...).  These should
contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use English) contains an indication of
the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your perl
binary was built for.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How come <I>exec()</I> doesn't return?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The <TT>&quot;exec&quot;</TT> function's job is to turn your process into another
command and never to return. If that's not what you want to do, don't
use <TT>&quot;exec&quot;</TT>. :)
<P>

If you want to run an external command and still keep your Perl process
going, look at a piped <TT>&quot;open&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;fork&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;system&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
(``mice'') is system-dependent.  Try the following modules:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Keyboard<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>


<PRE>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
        Term::ReadKey           CPAN
        Term::ReadLine::Gnu     CPAN
        Term::ReadLine::Perl    CPAN
        Term::Screen            CPAN

</PRE>


<DT>Screen<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>


<PRE>
        Term::Cap               Standard perl distribution
        Curses                  CPAN
        Term::ANSIColor         CPAN

</PRE>


<DT>Mouse<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>


<PRE>
        Tk                      CPAN

</PRE>


</DL>
<P>

Some of these specific cases are shown as examples in other answers
in this section of the perlfaq.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I print something out in color?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
In general, you don't, because you don't know whether
the recipient has a color-aware display device.  If you
know that they have an <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> terminal that understands
color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN:</FONT>
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ANSIColor;
        print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);
        print color(&quot;green&quot;), &quot;Go!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

Or like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
        print RED, &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, RESET;
        print GREEN, &quot;Go!\n&quot;, RESET;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter.
On many systems, you can just use the <B>stty</B> command as shown in
``getc'' in perlfunc, but as you see, that's already getting you into
portability snags.
<P>



<PRE>
        open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;
        system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
        $key = getc(TTY);               # perhaps this works
        # OR ELSE
        sysread(TTY, $key, 1);  # probably this does
        system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

The Term::ReadKey module from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> offers an easy-to-use interface that
should be more efficient than shelling out to <B>stty</B> for each key.
It even includes limited support for Windows.
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ReadKey;
        ReadMode('cbreak');
        $key = ReadKey(0);
        ReadMode('normal');

</PRE>


<P>

However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler
and can use it to build and install a <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module.  Here's a solution
using the standard <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> module, which is already on your systems
(assuming your system supports <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>).
<P>



<PRE>
        use HotKey;
        $key = readkey();

</PRE>


<P>

And here's the HotKey module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls
to manipulate the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> termios structures.
<P>



<PRE>
        # HotKey.pm
        package HotKey;

        @ISA = qw(Exporter);
        @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);

        use strict;
        use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
        my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);

        $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
        $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
        $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);
        $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();

        $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
        $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;

        sub cbreak {
                $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either
                $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);
                $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
        }

        sub cooked {
                $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
                $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0);
                $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
        }

        sub readkey {
                my $key = '';
                cbreak();
                sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
                cooked();
                return $key;
        }

        END { cooked() }

        1;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the
Term::ReadKey module from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate
not to block:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ReadKey;

        ReadMode('cbreak');

        if (defined ($char = ReadKey(-1)) ) {
                # input was waiting and it was $char
        } else {
                # no input was waiting
        }

        ReadMode('normal');                  # restore normal tty settings

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I clear the screen?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

To clear the screen, you just have to print the special sequence
that tells the terminal to clear the screen. Once you have that
sequence, output it when you want to clear the screen.
<P>

You can use the <TT>&quot;Term::ANSIScreen&quot;</TT> module to get the special
sequence. Import the <TT>&quot;cls&quot;</TT> function (or the <TT>&quot;:screen&quot;</TT> tag):
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ANSIScreen qw(cls);
        my $clear_screen = cls();

        print $clear_screen;

</PRE>


<P>

The <TT>&quot;Term::Cap&quot;</TT> module can also get the special sequence if you want
to deal with the low-level details of terminal control. The <TT>&quot;Tputs&quot;</TT>
method returns the string for the given capability:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::Cap;

        $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 } );
        $clear_string = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');

        print $clear_screen;

</PRE>


<P>

On Windows, you can use the <TT>&quot;Win32::Console&quot;</TT> module. After creating
an object for the output filehandle you want to affect, call the
<TT>&quot;Cls&quot;</TT> method:
<P>



<PRE>
        Win32::Console;

        $OUT = Win32::Console-&gt;new(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
        my $clear_string = $OUT-&gt;Cls;

        print $clear_screen;

</PRE>


<P>

If you have a command-line program that does the job, you can call
it in backticks to capture whatever it outputs so you can use it
later:
<P>



<PRE>
        $clear_string = `clear`;

        print $clear_string;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I get the screen size?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>,
you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters
and in pixels:
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ReadKey;
        ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();

</PRE>


<P>

This is more portable than the raw <TT>&quot;ioctl&quot;</TT>, but not as
illustrative:
<P>



<PRE>
        require 'sys/ioctl.ph';
        die &quot;no TIOCGWINSZ &quot; unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
        open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)                     or die &quot;No tty: $!&quot;;
        unless (ioctl(TTY, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {
                die sprintf &quot;$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\n&quot;, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
        }
        ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack('S4', $winsize);
        print &quot;(row,col) = ($row,$col)&quot;;
        print &quot;  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)&quot; if $xpixel || $ypixel;
        print &quot;\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I ask the user for a password?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
(This question has nothing to do with the web.  See a different
<FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> for that.)
<P>

There's an example of this in ``crypt'' in perlfunc).  First, you put the
terminal into ``no echo'' mode, then just read the password normally.
You may do this with an old-style <I>ioctl()</I> function, <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> terminal
control (see <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call
to the <B>stty</B> program, with varying degrees of portability.
<P>

You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module
from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.
<P>



<PRE>
        use Term::ReadKey;

        ReadMode('noecho');
        $password = ReadLine(0);

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I read and write the serial port?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
This depends on which operating system your program is running on.  In
the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
/dev; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ.
Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the
following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>lockfiles<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access.  Make sure
you follow the correct protocol.  Unpredictable behavior can result
from multiple processes reading from one device.
<DT>open mode<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device,
you'll have to open it for update (see ``open'' in perlfunc for
details).  You may wish to open it without running the risk of
blocking by using <I>sysopen()</I> and <TT>&quot;O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY&quot;</TT> from the
Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution).  See
``sysopen'' in perlfunc for more on this approach.
<DT>end of line<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
Some devices will be expecting a ``\r'' at the end of each line rather
than a ``\n''.  In some ports of perl, ``\r'' and ``\n'' are different from
their usual (Unix) <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> values of ``\012'' and ``\015''.  You may have to
give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (``\015''), hex
(``0x0D''), or as a control-character specification (``\cM'').


<P>




<PRE>
        print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;   # wrong, for some devices
        print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;   # right, for some devices

</PRE>




<P>


Even though with normal text files a ``\n'' will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable
between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>ALL</I></FONT><I></I> line
ends with ``\015\012'', and strip what you don't need from the output.
This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed
next.
<DT>flushing output<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
If you expect characters to get to your device when you <I>print()</I> them,
you'll want to autoflush that filehandle.  You can use <I>select()</I>
and the <TT>$|</TT> variable to control autoflushing (see ``$|'' in perlvar
and ``select'' in perlfunc, or perlfaq5, ``How do I flush/unbuffer an
output filehandle?  Why must I do this?''):


<P>




<PRE>
        $oldh = select(DEV);
        $| = 1;
        select($oldh);

</PRE>




<P>


You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in


<P>




<PRE>
        select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);

</PRE>




<P>


Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines
of code just because you're afraid of a little $| variable:


<P>




<PRE>
        use IO::Handle;
        DEV-&gt;<A HREF="/man/index.html?1+autoflush">autoflush</A>(1);

</PRE>




<P>


As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using
socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh.  You'll need to hard code your
line terminators, in that case.
<DT>non-blocking input<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
If you are doing a blocking <I>read()</I> or <I>sysread()</I>, you'll have to
arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
``alarm'' in perlfunc).  If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely
have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg
<I>select()</I> to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see
``select'' in perlfunc.
</DL>
<P>

While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski
<TT>&quot;&lt;<A HREF="mailto:jwz@netscape.com">jwz@netscape.com</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with sysread,
sysopen, <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>'s tcgetattr business, and various other functions that
go bump in the night, finally came up with this:
<P>



<PRE>
        sub open_modem {
                use IPC::Open2;
                my $stty = `/bin/stty -g`;
                open2( \*MODEM_IN, \*MODEM_OUT, &quot;cu -l$modem_device -s2400 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
                # starting cu hoses /dev/tty's stty settings, even when it has
                # been opened on a pipe...
                system(&quot;/bin/stty $stty&quot;);
                $_ = &lt;MODEM_IN&gt;;
                chomp;
                if ( !m/^Connected/ ) {
                        print STDERR &quot;$0: cu printed `$_' instead of `Connected'\n&quot;;
                }
        }

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I decode encrypted password files?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is
bound to get you talked about.
<P>

Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files---the Unix
password system employs one-way encryption.  It's more like hashing
than encryption.  The best you can do is check whether something else
hashes to the same string.  You can't turn a hash back into the
original string. Programs like Crack can forcibly (and intelligently)
try to guess passwords, but don't (can't) guarantee quick success.
<P>

If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
<I><A HREF="/man/index.html?1+passwd">passwd</A></I>(1), for example).
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I start a process in the background?</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

There's not a single way to run code in the background so you don't
have to wait for it to finish before your program moves on to other
tasks. Process management depends on your particular operating system,
and many of the techniques are in perlipc.
<P>

Several <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> modules may be able to help, including IPC::Open2 or
IPC::Open3, IPC::Run, Parallel::Jobs, Parallel::ForkManager, <FONT SIZE="-1">POE</FONT>,
Proc::Background, and Win32::Process. There are many other modules you
might use, so check those namespaces for other options too.
<P>

If you are on a unix-like system, you might be able to get away with a
system call where you put an <TT>&quot;&amp;&quot;</TT> on the end of the command:
<P>



<PRE>
        system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)

</PRE>


<P>

You can also try using <TT>&quot;fork&quot;</TT>, as described in perlfunc (although
this is the same thing that many of the modules will do for you).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">STDIN</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> are shared<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the ``child'' process)
share the same <FONT SIZE="-1">STDIN</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> filehandles.  If both try to
access them at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close
or reopen these for the child.  You can get around this with
<TT>&quot;open&quot;</TT>ing a pipe (see ``open'' in perlfunc) but on some systems this
means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.
<DT>Signals<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
You'll have to catch the <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGCHLD</FONT> signal, and possibly <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGPIPE</FONT> too.
<FONT SIZE="-1">SIGCHLD</FONT> is sent when the backgrounded process finishes.  <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGPIPE</FONT> is
sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an
untrapped <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGPIPE</FONT> can cause your program to silently die).  This is
not an issue with <TT>&quot;system(&quot;cmd&amp;&quot;)&quot;</TT>.
<DT>Zombies<DD>
<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
You have to be prepared to ``reap'' the child process when it finishes.


<P>




<PRE>
        $SIG{CHLD} = sub { wait };

        $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE';

</PRE>




<P>


You can also use a double fork. You immediately <I>wait()</I> for your
first child, and the init daemon will <I>wait()</I> for your grandchild once
it exits.


<P>




<PRE>
        unless ($pid = fork) {
            unless (fork) {
                exec &quot;what you really wanna do&quot;;
                die &quot;exec failed!&quot;;
            }
            exit 0;
        }
        waitpid($pid, 0);

</PRE>




<P>


See ``Signals'' in perlipc for other examples of code to do this.
Zombies are not an issue with <TT>&quot;system(&quot;prog &amp;&quot;)&quot;</TT>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I trap control characters/signals?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
You don't actually ``trap'' a control character.  Instead, that character
generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process.
Signals are documented in ``Signals'' in perlipc and the
section on ``Signals'' in the Camel.
<P>

You can set the values of the <TT>%SIG</TT> hash to be the functions you want
to handle the signal.  After perl catches the signal, it looks in <TT>%SIG</TT>
for a key with the same name as the signal, then calls the subroutine
value for that key.
<P>



<PRE>
        # as an anonymous subroutine

        $SIG{INT} = sub { syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5 ) };

        # or a reference to a function

        $SIG{INT} = \&amp;ouch;

        # or the name of the function as a string

        $SIG{INT} = &quot;ouch&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

Perl versions before 5.8 had in its C source code signal handlers which
would catch the signal and possibly run a Perl function that you had set
in <TT>%SIG</TT>.  This violated the rules of signal handling at that level
causing perl to dump core. Since version 5.8.0, perl looks at <TT>%SIG</TT>
*after* the signal has been caught, rather than while it is being caught.
Previous versions of this answer were incorrect.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
If perl was installed correctly and your shadow library was written
properly, the getpw*() functions described in perlfunc should in
theory provide (read-only) access to entries in the shadow password
file.  To change the file, make a new shadow password file (the format
varies from system to system---see passwd for specifics) and use
<I><A HREF="/man/index.html?8+pwd_mkdb">pwd_mkdb</A></I>(8) to install it (see pwd_mkdb for more details).
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How do I set the time and date?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
Assuming you're running under sufficient permissions, you should be
able to set the system-wide date and time by running the <I><A HREF="/man/index.html?1+date">date</A></I>(1)
program.  (There is no way to set the time and date on a per-process
basis.)  This mechanism will work for Unix, MS-DOS, Windows, and <FONT SIZE="-1">NT</FONT>;
the <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT> equivalent is <TT>&quot;set time&quot;</TT>.
<P>

However, if all you want to do is change your time zone, you can
probably get away with setting an environment variable:
<P>



<PRE>
        $ENV{TZ} = &quot;MST7MDT&quot;;              # unixish
        $ENV{'SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL'}=&quot;-5&quot; # vms

<H3>How can I <I>sleep()</I> or <I>alarm()</I> for under a second?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the <TT>&quot;sleep()&quot;</TT>
function provides, the easiest way is to use the <TT>&quot;select()&quot;</TT> function as
documented in ``select'' in perlfunc.  Try the <TT>&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</TT> and
the <TT>&quot;BSD::Itimer&quot;</TT> modules (available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, and starting from
Perl 5.8 <TT>&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</TT> is part of the standard distribution).
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I measure time under a second?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

The <TT>&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</TT> module (part of the standard distribution as of
Perl 5.8) measures time with the <TT>&quot;gettimeofday()&quot;</TT> system call, which
returns the time in microseconds since the epoch. If you can't install
<TT>&quot;Time::HiRes&quot;</TT> for older Perls and you are on a Unixish system, you
may be able to call <TT><A HREF="/man/index.html?2+gettimeofday">gettimeofday</A>(2)</TT> directly. See
``syscall'' in perlfunc.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I do an <I>atexit()</I> or <I>setjmp()</I>/<I>longjmp()</I>? (Exception handling)</H3>

<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
Release 5 of Perl added the <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> block, which can be used to simulate
<I>atexit()</I>.  Each package's <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> block is called when the program or
thread ends (see perlmod manpage for more details).
<P>

For example, you can use this to make sure your filter program
managed to finish its output without filling up the disk:
<P>



<PRE>
        END {
                close(STDOUT) || die &quot;stdout close failed: $!&quot;;
        }

</PRE>


<P>

The <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> block isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program,
though, so if you use <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> blocks you should also use
<P>



<PRE>
        use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);

</PRE>


<P>

Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its <I>eval()</I> operator.  You can
use <I>eval()</I> as setjmp and <I>die()</I> as longjmp.  For details of this, see
the section on signals, especially the time-out handler for a blocking
<I>flock()</I> in ``Signals'' in perlipc or the section on ``Signals'' in
the Camel Book.
<P>

If exception handling is all you're interested in, try the
exceptions.pl library (part of the standard perl distribution).
<P>

If you want the <I>atexit()</I> syntax (and an <I>rmexit()</I> as well), try the
AtExit module available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.

<H3>Why doesn't my sockets program work under System V (Solaris)?  What does the error message Protocol not supported mean?</H3>



<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the
standard socket constants.  Since these were constant across all
architectures, they were often hardwired into perl code.  The proper
way to deal with this is to ``use Socket'' to get the correct values.
<P>

Note that even though SunOS and Solaris are binary compatible, these
values are different.  Go figure.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I call my system's unique C functions from Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABK"></A>
In most cases, you write an external module to do it---see the answer
to ``Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]''.
However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports
<I>syscall()</I>, you can use the syscall function (documented in
perlfunc).
<P>

Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> as well---someone may already have written a module to do it. On
Windows, try Win32::API.  On Macs, try Mac::Carbon.  If no module
has an interface to the C function, you can inline a bit of C in your
Perl source with Inline::C.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Where do I get the include files to do <I>ioctl()</I> or <I>syscall()</I>?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABL"></A>
Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the
standard perl distribution.  This program converts <I><A HREF="/man/index.html?1+cpp">cpp</A></I>(1) directives
in C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like
&amp;SYS_getitimer, which you can use as arguments to your functions.
It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
Simple files like <I>errno.h</I>, <I>syscall.h</I>, and <I>socket.h</I> were fine,
but the hard ones like <I>ioctl.h</I> nearly always need to hand-edited.
Here's how to install the *.ph files:
<P>



<PRE>
        1.  become super-user
        2.  cd /usr/include
        3.  h2ph *.h */*.h

</PRE>


<P>

If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and
sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the standard perl
distribution).  This tool converts C header files to Perl extensions.
See perlxstut for how to get started with h2xs.
<P>

If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably
ought to use h2xs.  See perlxstut and ExtUtils::MakeMaker for
more information (in brief, just use <B>make perl</B> instead of a plain
<B>make</B> to rebuild perl with a new static extension).
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why do setuid perl scripts complain about kernel problems?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABM"></A>
Some operating systems have bugs in the kernel that make setuid
scripts inherently insecure.  Perl gives you a number of options
(described in perlsec) to work around such systems.
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I open a pipe both to and from a command?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABN"></A>
The IPC::Open2 module (part of the standard perl distribution) is an
easy-to-use approach that internally uses <I>pipe()</I>, <I>fork()</I>, and <I>exec()</I> to do
the job.  Make sure you read the deadlock warnings in its documentation,
though (see IPC::Open2).  See
``Bidirectional Communication with Another Process'' in perlipc and
``Bidirectional Communication with Yourself'' in perlipc
<P>

You may also use the IPC::Open3 module (part of the standard perl
distribution), but be warned that it has a different order of
arguments from IPC::Open2 (see IPC::Open3).
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why can't I get the output of a command with <I>system()</I>?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABO"></A>
You're confusing the purpose of <I>system()</I> and backticks (``).  <I>system()</I>
runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value:
the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and
the high 8 bits are the actual exit value).  Backticks (``) run a
command and return what it sent to <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>.
<P>



<PRE>
        $exit_status   = system(&quot;mail-users&quot;);
        $output_string = `ls`;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I capture <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> from an external command?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABP"></A>
There are three basic ways of running external commands:
<P>



<PRE>
        system $cmd;            # using system()
        $output = `$cmd`;               # using backticks (``)
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);   # using open()

</PRE>


<P>

With <I>system()</I>, both <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> will go the same place as the
script's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT>, unless the <I>system()</I> command redirects them.
Backticks and <I>open()</I> read <B>only</B> the <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> of your command.
<P>

You can also use the <I>open3()</I> function from IPC::Open3.  Benjamin
Goldberg provides some sample code:
<P>

To capture a program's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>, but discard its <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR:</FONT>
<P>



<PRE>
        use IPC::Open3;
        use File::Spec;
        use Symbol qw(gensym);
        open(NULL, &quot;&gt;&quot;, File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
        my $pid = open3(gensym, \*PH, &quot;&gt;&amp;NULL&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
        while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
        waitpid($pid, 0);

</PRE>


<P>

To capture a program's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT>, but discard its <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT:</FONT>
<P>



<PRE>
        use IPC::Open3;
        use File::Spec;
        use Symbol qw(gensym);
        open(NULL, &quot;&gt;&quot;, File::Spec-&gt;devnull);
        my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;NULL&quot;, \*PH, &quot;cmd&quot;);
        while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
        waitpid($pid, 0);

</PRE>


<P>

To capture a program's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT>, and let its <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> go to our own <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR:</FONT>
<P>



<PRE>
        use IPC::Open3;
        use Symbol qw(gensym);
        my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDERR&quot;, \*PH, &quot;cmd&quot;);
        while( &lt;PH&gt; ) { }
        waitpid($pid, 0);

</PRE>


<P>

To read both a command's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> and its <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> separately, you can
redirect them to temp files, let the command run, then read the temp
files:
<P>



<PRE>
        use IPC::Open3;
        use Symbol qw(gensym);
        use IO::File;
        local *CATCHOUT = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
        local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
        my $pid = open3(gensym, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHOUT&quot;, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
        waitpid($pid, 0);
        seek $_, 0, 0 for \*CATCHOUT, \*CATCHERR;
        while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
        while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}

</PRE>


<P>

But there's no real need for *both* to be tempfiles... the following
should work just as well, without deadlocking:
<P>



<PRE>
        use IPC::Open3;
        use Symbol qw(gensym);
        use IO::File;
        local *CATCHERR = IO::File-&gt;new_tmpfile;
        my $pid = open3(gensym, \*CATCHOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;CATCHERR&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;);
        while( &lt;CATCHOUT&gt; ) {}
        waitpid($pid, 0);
        seek CATCHERR, 0, 0;
        while( &lt;CATCHERR&gt; ) {}

</PRE>


<P>

And it'll be faster, too, since we can begin processing the program's
stdout immediately, rather than waiting for the program to finish.
<P>

With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:
<P>



<PRE>
        open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
        system(&quot;ls&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:
<P>



<PRE>
        $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> a
duplicate of <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT:</FONT>
<P>



<PRE>
        $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
        open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

Note that you <I>cannot</I> simply open <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> to be a dup of <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>
in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection.
This doesn't work:
<P>



<PRE>
        open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
        $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes

</PRE>


<P>

This fails because the <I>open()</I> makes <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> go to where <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> was
going at the time of the <I>open()</I>.  The backticks then make <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> go to
a string, but don't change <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> (which still goes to the old
<FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>).
<P>

Note that you <I>must</I> use Bourne shell (<I><A HREF="/man/index.html?1+sh">sh</A></I>(1)) redirection syntax in
backticks, not <I><A HREF="/man/index.html?1+csh">csh</A></I>(1)!  Details on why Perl's <I>system()</I> and backtick
and pipe opens all use the Bourne shell are in the
<I>versus/csh.whynot</I> article in the ``Far More Than You Ever Wanted To
Know'' collection in <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz">http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz</A> .  To

<P>

To read both a command's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> and its <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> separately, it's easiest

when the program is done:
<P>



<PRE>
        system(&quot;program args 1&gt;program.stdout 2&gt;program.stderr&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

Ordering is important in all these examples.  That's because the shell
processes file descriptor redirections in strictly left to right order.
<P>



<PRE>
        system(&quot;prog args 1&gt;tmpfile 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
        system(&quot;prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile&quot;);

</PRE>


<P>

The first command sends both standard out and standard error to the
temporary file.  The second command sends only the old standard output
there, and the old standard error shows up on the old standard out.
<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Why doesn't <I>open()</I> return an error when a pipe open fails?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABQ"></A>
If the second argument to a piped <I>open()</I> contains shell
metacharacters, perl <I>fork()</I>s, then <I>exec()</I>s a shell to decode the
metacharacters and eventually run the desired program.  If the program
couldn't be run, it's the shell that gets the message, not Perl. All
your Perl program can find out is whether the shell itself could be
successfully started.  You can still capture the shell's <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> and
check it for error messages.  See ``How can I capture <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> from an
external command?'' elsewhere in this document, or use the
IPC::Open3 module.
<P>

If there are no shell metacharacters in the argument of <I>open()</I>, Perl
runs the command directly, without using the shell, and can correctly
report whether the command started.
<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABR"></A>
Strictly speaking, nothing.  Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
way to write maintainable code.  Perl has several operators for
running external commands.  Backticks are one; they collect the output
from the command for use in your program.  The <TT>&quot;system&quot;</TT> function is
another; it doesn't do this.
<P>

Writing backticks in your program sends a clear message to the readers
of your code that you wanted to collect the output of the command.
Why send a clear message that isn't true?
<P>

Consider this line:
<P>



<PRE>
        `cat /etc/termcap`;

</PRE>


<P>

You forgot to check <TT>$?</TT> to see whether the program even ran
correctly.  Even if you wrote
<P>



<PRE>
        print `cat /etc/termcap`;

</PRE>


<P>

this code could and probably should be written as
<P>



<PRE>
        system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
        or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

which will echo the cat command's output as it is generated, instead
of waiting until the program has completed to print it out. It also
checks the return value.
<P>

<TT>&quot;system&quot;</TT> also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard
processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.
<A NAME="lbBE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>How can I call backticks without shell processing?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
This is a bit tricky.  You can't simply write the command
like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        @ok = `grep @opts '$search_string' @filenames`;

</PRE>


<P>

As of Perl 5.8.0, you can use <TT>&quot;open()&quot;</TT> with multiple arguments.
Just like the list forms of <TT>&quot;system()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;exec()&quot;</TT>, no shell
escapes happen.
<P>



<PRE>
        open( GREP, &quot;-|&quot;, 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames );
        chomp(@ok = &lt;GREP&gt;);
        close GREP;

</PRE>


<P>

You can also:
<P>



<PRE>
        my @ok = ();
        if (open(GREP, &quot;-|&quot;)) {
                while (&lt;GREP&gt;) {
                        chomp;
                        push(@ok, $_);
                }
                close GREP;
        } else {
                exec 'grep', @opts, $search_string, @filenames;
        }

</PRE>


<P>

Just as with <TT>&quot;system()&quot;</TT>, no shell escapes happen when you <TT>&quot;exec()&quot;</TT> a
list. Further examples of this can be found in ``Safe Pipe
Opens'' in perlipc.
<P>

Note that if you're using Windows, no solution to this vexing issue is
even possible.  Even if Perl were to emulate <TT>&quot;fork()&quot;</TT>, you'd still be
stuck, because Windows does not have an argc/argv-style <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>.

<A NAME="ixABT"></A>
Some stdio's set error and eof flags that need clearing.  The

technically correct way to do it.  Here are some less reliable

<PRE>
        $where = tell(LOG);

<DT>2.<DD>
If that doesn't work, try seeking to a different part of the file and
then back.
<DT>3.<DD>
If that doesn't work, try seeking to a different part of

<H3>How can I convert my shell script to perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABU"></A>
Learn Perl and rewrite it.  Seriously, there's no simple converter.
Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and
this very awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter
nigh-on impossible to write.  By rewriting it, you'll think about what
you're really trying to do, and hopefully will escape the shell's
pipeline datastream paradigm, which while convenient for some matters,
causes many inefficiencies.

If all you want to do is pretend to be telnet but don't need

<H3>How can I write expect in Perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixABW"></A>
Once upon a time, there was a library called chat2.pl (part of the
standard perl distribution), which never really got finished.  If you
find it somewhere, <I>don't use it</I>.  These days, your best bet is to
look at the Expect module available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, which also requires two
other modules from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, IO::Pty and IO::Stty.

<H3>Is there a way to hide perl's command line from programs such as ps?</H3>



<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
First of all note that if you're doing this for security reasons (to
avoid people seeing passwords, for example) then you should rewrite
your program so that critical information is never given as an
argument.  Hiding the arguments won't make your program completely
secure.
<P>

To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the
variable <TT>$0</TT> as documented in perlvar.  This won't work on all
operating systems, though.  Daemon programs like sendmail place their
state there, as in:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Unix<DD>
<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
In the strictest sense, it can't be done---the script executes as a
different process from the shell it was started from.  Changes to a
process are not reflected in its parent---only in any children
created after the change.  There is shell magic that may allow you to
fake it by <I>eval()</I>ing the script's output in your shell; check out the

<H3>How do I close a process's filehandle without waiting for it to complete?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACA"></A>
Assuming your system supports such things, just send an appropriate signal

Open /dev/tty and use the <FONT SIZE="-1">TIOCNOTTY</FONT> ioctl on it.  See tty

<P>

This sets the soft and hard limits to 10 and 20 seconds, respectively.
After 10 seconds of time spent running on the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> (not ``wall'' time),
the process will be sent a signal (<FONT SIZE="-1">XCPU</FONT> on some systems) which, if not
trapped, will cause the process to terminate.  If that signal is
trapped, then after 10 more seconds (20 seconds in total) the process
will be killed with a non-trappable signal.

<H3>How do I tell the difference between errors from the shell and perl?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACK"></A>
(answer contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

When you run a Perl script, something else is running the script for you,
and that something else may output error messages.  The script might
emit its own warnings and error messages.  Most of the time you cannot
tell who said what.
<P>

You probably cannot fix the thing that runs perl, but you can change how
perl outputs its warnings by defining a custom warning and die functions.
<P>

Consider this script, which has an error you may not notice immediately.
<P>



<PRE>
        #!/usr/locl/bin/perl

        print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

I get an error when I run this from my shell (which happens to be
bash).  That may look like perl forgot it has a <I>print()</I> function,
but my shebang line is not the path to perl, so the shell runs the
script, and I get the error.
<P>



<PRE>
        $ ./test
        ./test: line 3: print: command not found

</PRE>


<P>

A quick and dirty fix involves a little bit of code, but this may be all
you need to figure out the problem.
<P>



<PRE>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w

        BEGIN {
        $SIG{__WARN__} = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; };
        $SIG{__DIE__}  = sub{ print STDERR &quot;Perl: &quot;, @_; exit 1};
        }

        $a = 1 + undef;
        $x / 0;
        __END__

</PRE>


<P>

The perl message comes out with ``Perl'' in front.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT> block
works at compile time so all of the compilation errors and warnings
get the ``Perl:'' prefix too.
<P>



<PRE>
        Perl: Useless use of division (/) in void context at ./test line 9.
        Perl: Name &quot;main::a&quot; used only once: possible typo at ./test line 8.

        Perl: Illegal division by zero at ./test line 9.
        Perl: Illegal division by zero at -e line 3.

</PRE>


<P>

If I don't see that ``Perl:'', it's not from perl.
<P>

You could also just know all the perl errors, and although there are
some people who may know all of them, you probably don't.  However, they
all should be in the perldiag manpage. If you don't find the error in
there, it probably isn't a perl error.
<P>

Looking up every message is not the easiest way, so let perl to do it
for you.  Use the diagnostics pragma with turns perl's normal messages
into longer discussions on the topic.
<P>

If your version of perl is compiled without dynamic loading, then you
just need to replace step 3 (<B>make</B>) with <B>make perl</B> and you will
get a new <I>perl</I> binary with your extension linked in.

<H3>What's the difference between require and use?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

Perl runs <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT> statement at run-time. Once Perl loads, compiles,
and runs the file, it doesn't do anything else. The <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> statement
is the same as a <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT> run at compile-time, but Perl also calls the
<TT>&quot;import&quot;</TT> method for the loaded package. These two are the same:
<P>



<PRE>
        use MODULE qw(import list);

        BEGIN {
                require MODULE;
                MODULE-&gt;import(import list);
                }

</PRE>


<P>

However, you can suppress the <TT>&quot;import&quot;</TT> by using an explicit, empty
import list. Both of these still happen at compile-time:
<P>



<PRE>
        use MODULE ();

        BEGIN {
                require MODULE;
                }

</PRE>


<P>

Since <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> will also call the <TT>&quot;import&quot;</TT> method, the actual value
for <TT>&quot;MODULE&quot;</TT> must be a bareword. That is, <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> cannot load files
by name, although <TT>&quot;require&quot;</TT> can:
<P>



<PRE>
        require &quot;$ENV{HOME}/lib/Foo.pm&quot;; # no @INC searching!

<H3>How do I keep my own module/library directory?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
When you build modules, tell Perl where to install the modules.
<P>

For <TT>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</TT>-based distributions, use the <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL_BASE</FONT> option
when generating Makefiles:
<P>



<PRE>
        perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl

</PRE>


<P>

You can set this in your <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm configuration so modules automatically install
in your private library directory when you use the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm shell:
<P>



<PRE>
        % cpan
        cpan&gt; o conf makepl_arg INSTALL_BASE=/mydir/perl
        cpan&gt; o conf commit

</PRE>


<P>

For <TT>&quot;Build.PL&quot;</TT>-based distributions, use the --install_base option:
<P>



<PRE>
        perl Build.PL --install_base /mydir/perl

</PRE>


<P>

You can configure <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm to automatically use this option too:
<P>



<PRE>
        % cpan
        cpan&gt; o conf mbuild_arg --install_base /mydir/perl
        cpan&gt; o conf commit

</PRE>


<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL_BASE</FONT> tells these tools to put your modules into
<I>/mydir/perl/lib/perl5</I>.  See ``How do I add a directory to my
include path (@INC) at runtime?'' for details on how to run your newly
installed moudles.
<P>

There is one caveat with <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL_BASE</FONT>, though, since it acts
differently than the <FONT SIZE="-1">PREFIX</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">LIB</FONT> settings that older versions of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker advocated. <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL_BASE</FONT> does not support
installing modules for multiple versions of Perl or different
architectures under the same directory. You should consider if you
really want that , and if you do, use the older <FONT SIZE="-1">PREFIX</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">LIB</FONT>
settings. See the ExtUtils::Makemaker documentation for more details.

<H3>How do I add the directory my program lives in to the module/library search path?</H3>

<A NAME="ixACO"></A>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<P>

If you know the directory already, you can add it to <TT>@INC</TT> as you would
for any other directory. You might &lt;use lib&gt; if you know the directory
at compile time:
<P>



<PRE>
        use lib $directory;

</PRE>


<P>

The trick in this task is to find the directory. Before your script does
anything else (such as a <TT>&quot;chdir&quot;</TT>), you can get the current working
directory with the <TT>&quot;Cwd&quot;</TT> module, which comes with Perl:
<P>



<PRE>
        BEGIN {
                use Cwd;
                our $directory = cwd;
                }

        use lib $directory;

</PRE>


<P>

You can do a similar thing with the value of <TT>$0</TT>, which holds the
script name. That might hold a relative path, but <TT>&quot;rel2abs&quot;</TT> can turn
it into an absolute path. Once you have the
<P>



<PRE>
        BEGIN {
                use File::Spec::Functions qw(rel2abs);
                use File::Basename qw(dirname);

                my $path   = rel2abs( $0 );
                our $directory = dirname( $path );
                }

        use lib $directory;

</PRE>


<P>

The <TT>&quot;FindBin&quot;</TT> module, which comes with Perl, might work. It finds the
directory of the currently running script and puts it in <TT>$Bin</TT>, which
you can then use to construct the right library path:
