<H2>NAME</H2>

Class::ISA -- report the search path for a class's ISA tree
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>


<PRE>
  # Suppose you go: use Food::Fishstick, and that uses and
  # inherits from other things, which in turn use and inherit
  # from other things.  And suppose, for sake of brevity of
  # example, that their ISA tree is the same as:

  @Food::Fishstick::ISA = qw(Food::Fish  Life::Fungus  Chemicals);
  @Food::Fish::ISA = qw(Food);
  @Food::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Life::Fungus::ISA = qw(Life);
  @Chemicals::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Life::ISA = qw(Matter);
  @Matter::ISA = qw();

  use Class::ISA;
  print &quot;Food::Fishstick path is:\n &quot;,
        join(&quot;, &quot;, Class::ISA::super_path('Food::Fishstick')),
        &quot;\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

That prints:
<P>



<PRE>
  Food::Fishstick path is:
   Food::Fish, Food, Matter, Life::Fungus, Life, Chemicals

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived,
via its <TT>@ISA</TT>, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick
is from Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those
superclasses may themselves each be derived, via its <TT>@ISA</TT>, from one or
more superclasses (as above).
<P>

When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick-&gt;calories),
Perl first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it
goes searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or
maybe ``height-first'' is the word) search.  In the above example, it'd
first look in Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus,
then Life, then Chemicals.
<P>

This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list ---
the list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a
method, with no duplicates.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>the function Class::ISA::super_path($CLASS)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
This returns the ordered list of names of classes that Perl would
search thru in order to find a method, with no duplicates in the list.
<TT>$CLASS</TT> is not included in the list.  <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIVERSAL</FONT> is not included --- if
you need to consider it, add it to the end.
<DT>the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_path($CLASS)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Just like <TT>&quot;super_path&quot;</TT>, except that <TT>$CLASS</TT> is included as the first
element.
<DT>the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_versions($CLASS)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
This returns a hash whose keys are <TT>$CLASS</TT> and its
(super-)superclasses, and whose values are the contents of each
class's <TT>$VERSION</TT> (or undef, for classes with no <TT>$VERSION</TT>).


<P>


The code for self_and_super_versions is meant to serve as an example
for precisely the kind of tasks I anticipate that self_and_super_path
and super_path will be used for.  You are strongly advised to read the
source for self_and_super_versions, and the comments there.

<H2>CAUTIONARY NOTES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
* Class::ISA doesn't export anything.  You have to address the
functions with a ``Class::ISA::'' on the front.
<P>

* Contrary to its name, Class::ISA isn't a class; it's just a package.
Strange, isn't it?
<P>

* Say you have a loop in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> tree of the class you're calling one
of the Class::ISA functions on: say that Food inherits from Matter,
but Matter inherits from Food (for sake of argument).  If Perl, while
searching for a method, actually discovers this cyclicity, it will
throw a fatal error.  The functions in Class::ISA effectively ignore
this cyclicity; the Class::ISA algorithm is ``never go down the same
path twice'', and cyclicities are just a special case of that.
<P>

* The Class::ISA functions just look at <TT>@ISAs</TT>.  But theoretically, I
suppose, AUTOLOADs could bypass Perl's ISA-based search mechanism and
do whatever they please.  That would be bad behavior, tho; and I try
not to think about that.
<P>

* If Perl can't find a method anywhere in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> tree, it then looks
in the magical class <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIVERSAL</FONT>.  This is rarely relevant to the tasks
that I expect Class::ISA functions to be put to, but if it matters to
you, then instead of this:
<P>



<PRE>
  @supers = Class::Tree::super_path($class);

</PRE>


<P>

do this:
<P>



<PRE>
  @supers = (Class::Tree::super_path($class), 'UNIVERSAL');

</PRE>


<P>

And don't say no-one ever told ya!
<P>

* When you call them, the Class::ISA functions look at <TT>@ISAs</TT> anew ---
that is, there is no memoization, and so if ISAs change during
runtime, you get the current <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> tree's path, not anything memoized.
However, changing ISAs at runtime is probably a sign that you're out
of your mind!
