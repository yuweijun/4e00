<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module automates or at least simplifies the make and install
of perl modules and extensions. It includes some primitive searching
capabilities and knows how to use Net::FTP, <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT>, and certain external
download clients to fetch distributions from the net.
<P>

These are fetched from one or more mirrored <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> (Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network) sites and unpacked in a dedicated directory.
<P>

The <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module also supports named and versioned
<I>bundles</I> of modules. Bundles simplify handling of sets of
related modules. See Bundles below.
<P>

The package contains a session manager and a cache manager. The
session manager keeps track of what has been fetched, built, and
installed in the current session. The cache manager keeps track of the
disk space occupied by the make processes and deletes excess space
using a simple <FONT SIZE="-1">FIFO</FONT> mechanism.
<P>

All methods provided are accessible in a programmer style and in an
interactive shell style.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>CPAN::shell([$prompt, $command]) Starting Interactive Mode</H3>



<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Enter interactive mode by running
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -MCPAN -e shell

which puts you into a readline interface. If <TT>&quot;Term::ReadKey&quot;</TT> and
either of <TT>&quot;Term::ReadLine::Perl&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Term::ReadLine::Gnu&quot;</TT> are installed,
history and command completion are supported.
<P>

Once at the command line, type <TT>&quot;h&quot;</TT> for one-page help
screen; the rest should be self-explanatory.
<P>

The function call <TT>&quot;shell&quot;</TT> takes two optional arguments: one the
prompt, the second the default initial command line (the latter
only works if a real ReadLine interface module is installed).
<P>

The most common uses of the interactive modes are
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
There are corresponding one-letter commands <TT>&quot;a&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;d&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;m&quot;</TT>
for each of the four categories and another, <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT> for any of the
mentioned four. Each of the four entities is implemented as a class
with slightly differing methods for displaying an object.


<P>


Arguments to these commands are either strings exactly matching
the identification string of an object, or regular expressions 
matched case-insensitively against various attributes of the
objects. The parser only recognizes a regular expression when you
enclose it with slashes.


<P>


The principle is that the number of objects found influences how an
item is displayed. If the search finds one item, the result is
displayed with the rather verbose method <TT>&quot;as_string&quot;</TT>, but if 
more than one is found, each object is displayed with the terse method
<TT>&quot;as_glimpse&quot;</TT>.

<P>


The examples illustrate several aspects: the first three queries
target modules, authors, or distros directly and yield exactly one
result. The last two use regular expressions and yield several
results. The last one targets all of bundles, modules, authors, and
distros simultaneously. When more than one result is available, they
are printed in one-line format.
<DT>get, make, test, install, clean modules or distributions<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
These commands take any number of arguments and investigate what is
necessary to perform the action. If the argument is a distribution
file name (recognized by embedded slashes), it is processed. If it is
a module, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> determines the distribution file in which this module
is included and processes that, following any dependencies named in
the module's <FONT SIZE="-1">META</FONT>.yml or Makefile.PL (this behavior is controlled by
the configuration parameter <TT>&quot;prerequisites_policy&quot;</TT>.)


<P>


<TT>&quot;get&quot;</TT> downloads a distribution file and untars or unzips it, <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>
builds it, <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> runs the test suite, and <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> installs it.


<P>


Any <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> is run unconditionally. An


<P>




<PRE>
  install &lt;distribution_file&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


is also run unconditionally. But for


<P>




<PRE>
  install &lt;module&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> checks whether an install is needed and prints
<I>module up to date</I> if the distribution file containing
the module doesn't need updating.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> also keeps track of what it has done within the current session
and doesn't try to build a package a second time regardless of whether it
succeeded or not. It does not repeat a test run if the test
has been run successfully before. Same for install runs.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;force&quot;</TT> pragma may precede another command (currently: <TT>&quot;get&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT>) to execute the command from scratch
and attempt to continue past certain errors. See the section below on
the <TT>&quot;force&quot;</TT> and the <TT>&quot;fforce&quot;</TT> pragma.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;notest&quot;</TT> pragma skips the test part in the build
process.


<P>


Example:


<P>




<PRE>
    cpan&gt; notest install Tk

</PRE>




<P>


A <TT>&quot;clean&quot;</TT> command results in a


<P>




<PRE>
  make clean

</PRE>




<P>


being executed within the distribution file's working directory.
<DT>readme, perldoc, look module or distribution<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
<TT>&quot;readme&quot;</TT> displays the <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT> file of the associated distribution.
<TT>&quot;Look&quot;</TT> gets and untars (if not yet done) the distribution file,
changes to the appropriate directory and opens a subshell process in
that directory. <TT>&quot;perldoc&quot;</TT> displays the module's pod documentation 
in html or plain text format.
<DT>ls author<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>

<DT>ls globbing_expression<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>

The first form lists all distribution files in and below an author's
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> directory as stored in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CHECKUMS</FONT> files distributed on
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>. The listing recurses into subdirectories.


<P>


The second form limits or expands the output with shell
globbing as in the following examples:


<P>




<PRE>
      ls JV/make*
      ls GSAR/*make*
      ls */*make*

</PRE>




<P>


The last example is very slow and outputs extra progress indicators
that break the alignment of the result.


<P>


Note that globbing only lists directories explicitly asked for, for
example FOO/* will not list FOO/bar/Acme-Sthg-n.nn.tar.gz. This may be
regarded as a bug that may be changed in some future version.
<DT>failed<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
The <TT>&quot;failed&quot;</TT> command reports all distributions that failed on one of
<TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> for some reason in the currently
running shell session.
<DT>Persistence between sessions<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
If the <TT>&quot;YAML&quot;</TT> or the <TT>&quot;YAML::Syck&quot;</TT> module is installed a record of
the internal state of all modules is written to disk after each step.
The files contain a signature of the currently running perl version
for later perusal.


<P>


If the configurations variable <TT>&quot;build_dir_reuse&quot;</TT> is set to a true
value, then <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm reads the collected <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> files. If the stored
signature matches the currently running perl, the stored state is
loaded into memory such that persistence between sessions
is effectively established.
<DT>The force and the fforce pragma<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
To speed things up in complex installation scenarios, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm keeps
track of what it has already done and refuses to do some things a
second time. A <TT>&quot;get&quot;</TT>, a <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>, and an <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> are not repeated.
A <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> is repeated only if the previous test was unsuccessful. The
diagnostic message when <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm refuses to do something a second time
is one of <I>Has already been </I><TT>&quot;unwrapped|made|tested successfully&quot;</TT> or
something similar. Another situation where <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> refuses to act is an
<TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> if the corresponding <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> was not successful.


<P>


In all these cases, the user can override this stubborn behaviour by
prepending the command with the word force, for example:


<P>




<PRE>
  cpan&gt; force get Foo
  cpan&gt; force make AUTHOR/Bar-3.14.tar.gz
  cpan&gt; force test Baz
  cpan&gt; force install Acme::Meta

</PRE>




<P>


Each <I>forced</I> command is executed with the corresponding part of its
memory erased.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;fforce&quot;</TT> pragma is a variant that emulates a <TT>&quot;force get&quot;</TT> which
erases the entire memory followed by the action specified, effectively
restarting the whole get/make/test/install procedure from scratch.
<DT>Lockfile<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
Interactive sessions maintain a lockfile, by default <TT>&quot;~/.cpan/.lock&quot;</TT>.
Batch jobs can run without a lockfile and not disturb each other.


<P>


The shell offers to run in <I>downgraded mode</I> when another process is
holding the lockfile. This is an experimental feature that is not yet
tested very well. This second shell then does not write the history
file, does not use the metadata file, and has a different prompt.
<DT>Signals<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm installs signal handlers for <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGINT</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGTERM</FONT>. While you are
in the cpan-shell, it is intended that you can press <TT>&quot;^C&quot;</TT> anytime and
return to the cpan-shell prompt. A <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGTERM</FONT> will cause the cpan-shell
to clean up and leave the shell loop. You can emulate the effect of a
<FONT SIZE="-1">SIGTERM</FONT> by sending two consecutive SIGINTs, which usually means by
pressing <TT>&quot;^C&quot;</TT> twice.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm ignores <FONT SIZE="-1">SIGPIPE</FONT>. If the user sets <TT>&quot;inactivity_timeout&quot;</TT>, a
<FONT SIZE="-1">SIGALRM</FONT> is used during the run of the <TT>&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;perl
Build.PL&quot;</TT> subprocess.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>CPAN::Shell</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
The commands available in the shell interface are methods in
the package CPAN::Shell. If you enter the shell command, your
input is split by the <I>Text::ParseWords::shellwords()</I> routine, which
acts like most shells do. The first word is interpreted as the
method to be invoked, and the rest of the words are treated as the method's arguments.
Continuation lines are supported by ending a line with a
literal backslash.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>autobundle</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
<TT>&quot;autobundle&quot;</TT> writes a bundle file into the
<TT>&quot;$CPAN::Config-&gt;{cpan_home}/Bundle&quot;</TT> directory. The file contains
a list of all modules that are both available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and currently
installed within <TT>@INC</TT>. The name of the bundle file is based on the
current date and a counter.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>hosts</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future
versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm
<P>

This commands provides a statistical overview over recent download
activities. The data for this is collected in the <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> file
<TT>&quot;FTPstats.yml&quot;</TT> in your <TT>&quot;cpan_home&quot;</TT> directory. If no <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> module is
configured or <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> not installed, no stats are provided.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>mkmyconfig</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
<I>mkmyconfig()</I> writes your own CPAN::MyConfig file into your <TT>&quot;~/.cpan/&quot;</TT>
directory so that you can save your own preferences instead of the
system-wide ones.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>recent ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
The <TT>&quot;recent&quot;</TT> command downloads a list of recent uploads to <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and
displays them <I>slowly</I>. While the command is running, a <TT>$SIG</TT>{<FONT SIZE="-1">INT</FONT>} 
exits the loop after displaying the current item.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: This command requires XML::LibXML installed.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: This whole command currently is just a hack and will
probably change in future versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm, but the general
approach will likely remain.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: See also smoke
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>recompile</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
<I>recompile()</I> is a special command that takes no argument and
runs the make/test/install cycle with brute force over all installed
dynamically loadable extensions (aka <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> modules) with 'force' in
effect. The primary purpose of this command is to finish a network
installation. Imagine you have a common source tree for two different
architectures. You decide to do a completely independent fresh
installation. You start on one architecture with the help of a Bundle
file produced earlier. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> installs the whole Bundle for you, but
when you try to repeat the job on the second architecture, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
responds with a <TT>&quot;Foo up to date&quot;</TT> message for all modules. So you
invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>'s recompile on the second architecture and you're done.
<P>

Another popular use for <TT>&quot;recompile&quot;</TT> is to act as a rescue in case your
perl breaks binary compatibility. If one of the modules that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> uses
is in turn depending on binary compatibility (so you cannot run <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
commands), then you should try the CPAN::Nox module for recovery.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>report Bundle|Distribution|Module</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
The <TT>&quot;report&quot;</TT> command temporarily turns on the <TT>&quot;test_report&quot;</TT> config
variable, then runs the <TT>&quot;force test&quot;</TT> command with the given
arguments. The <TT>&quot;force&quot;</TT> pragma reruns the tests and repeats
every step that might have failed before.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>smoke ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
<B>*** </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>WARNING:</B></FONT><B> this command downloads and executes software from </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPAN</B></FONT><B> to
your computer of completely unknown status. You should never do
this with your normal account and better have a dedicated well
separated and secured machine to do this. ***</B>
<P>

The <TT>&quot;smoke&quot;</TT> command takes the list of recent uploads to <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> as
provided by the <TT>&quot;recent&quot;</TT> command and tests them all. While the
command is running <TT>$SIG</TT>{<FONT SIZE="-1">INT</FONT>} is defined to mean that the current item
shall be skipped.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: This whole command currently is just a hack and will
probably change in future versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm, but the general
approach will likely remain.
<P>

<B>Note</B>: See also recent
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>upgrade [Module|/Regex/]...</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
The <TT>&quot;upgrade&quot;</TT> command first runs an <TT>&quot;r&quot;</TT> command with the given
arguments and then installs the newest versions of all modules that
were listed by that.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The four CPAN::* Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution</H3>



<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
Although it may be considered internal, the class hierarchy does matter
for both users and programmer. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm deals with the four
classes mentioned above, and those classes all share a set of methods. Classical
single polymorphism is in effect. A metaclass object registers all
objects of all kinds and indexes them with a string. The strings
referencing objects have a separated namespace (well, not completely
separated):
<P>



<PRE>
         Namespace                         Class

   words containing a &quot;/&quot; (slash)      Distribution
    words starting with Bundle::          Bundle
          everything else            Module or Author

</PRE>


<P>

Modules know their associated Distribution objects. They always refer
to the most recent official release. Developers may mark their releases
as unstable development versions (by inserting an underbar into the
module version number which will also be reflected in the distribution
name when you run 'make dist'), so the really hottest and newest
distribution is not always the default.  If a module Foo circulates
on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> in both version 1.23 and 1.23_90, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm offers a convenient
way to install version 1.23 by saying
<P>



<PRE>
    install Foo

</PRE>


<P>

This would install the complete distribution file (say
BAR/Foo-1.23.tar.gz) with all accompanying material. But if you would
like to install version 1.23_90, you need to know where the
distribution file resides on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> relative to the authors/id/
directory. If the author is <FONT SIZE="-1">BAR</FONT>, this might be BAR/Foo-1.23_90.tar.gz;
so you would have to say
<P>



<PRE>
    install BAR/Foo-1.23_90.tar.gz

</PRE>


<P>

The first example will be driven by an object of the class
CPAN::Module, the second by an object of class CPAN::Distribution.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Integrating local directories</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future
versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm
<P>

Distribution objects are normally distributions from the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, but
there is a slightly degenerate case for Distribution objects, too, of
projects held on the local disk. These distribution objects have the
same name as the local directory and end with a dot. A dot by itself
is also allowed for the current directory at the time <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm was
used. All actions such as <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> are applied
directly to that directory. This gives the command <TT>&quot;cpan .&quot;</TT> an
interesting touch: while the normal mantra of installing a <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module
without <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm is one of
<P>



<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL                 perl Build.PL
           ( go and get prerequisites )
    make                             ./Build
    make test                        ./Build test
    make install                     ./Build install

</PRE>


<P>

the command <TT>&quot;cpan .&quot;</TT> does all of this at once. It figures out which
of the two mantras is appropriate, fetches and installs all
prerequisites, takes care of them recursively, and finally finishes the
installation of the module in the current directory, be it a <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
module or not.
<P>

The typical usage case is for private modules or working copies of
projects from remote repositories on the local disk.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Redirection</H3>

<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
The usual shell redirection symbols <TT>&quot; | &quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;&gt;&quot;</TT> are recognized
by the cpan shell <B>only when surrounded by whitespace</B>. So piping to
pager or redirecting output into a file works somewhat as in a normal
shell, with the stipulation that you must type extra spaces.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
When the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module is used for the first time, a configuration
dialogue tries to determine a couple of site specific options. The
result of the dialog is stored in a hash reference <TT> $CPAN::Config </TT>
in a file CPAN/Config.pm.
<P>

Default values defined in the CPAN/Config.pm file can be
overridden in a user specific file: CPAN/MyConfig.pm. Such a file is
best placed in <TT>&quot;$HOME/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm&quot;</TT>, because <TT>&quot;$HOME/.cpan&quot;</TT> is
added to the search path of the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module before the <I>use()</I> or
<I>require()</I> statements. The mkmyconfig command writes this file for you.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;o conf&quot;</TT> command has various bells and whistles:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>completion support<DD>
<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
If you have a ReadLine module installed, you can hit <FONT SIZE="-1">TAB</FONT> at any point
of the commandline and <TT>&quot;o conf&quot;</TT> will offer you completion for the
built-in subcommands and/or config variable names.
<DT>displaying some help: o conf help<DD>
<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
Displays a short help
<DT>displaying current values: o conf [<FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT>]<DD>
<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
Displays the current value(s) for this config variable. Without <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT>,
displays all subcommands and config variables.


<P>


Example:


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf shell

</PRE>




<P>


If <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT> starts and ends with a slash, the string in between is
treated as a regular expression and only keys matching this regex
are displayed


<P>


Example:


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf /color/

</PRE>


<DT>changing of scalar values: o conf <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">VALUE</FONT><DD>
<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
Sets the config variable <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT> to <FONT SIZE="-1">VALUE</FONT>. The empty string can be
specified as usual in shells, with <TT>''</TT> or <TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>


<P>


Example:


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf wget /usr/bin/wget

</PRE>


<DT>changing of list values: o conf <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT> SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST<DD>
<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
If a config variable name ends with <TT>&quot;list&quot;</TT>, it is a list. <TT>&quot;o conf
KEY shift&quot;</TT> removes the first element of the list, <TT>&quot;o conf KEY pop&quot;</TT>
removes the last element of the list. <TT>&quot;o conf KEYS unshift LIST&quot;</TT>
prepends a list of values to the list, <TT>&quot;o conf KEYS push LIST&quot;</TT>
appends a list of valued to the list.


<P>


Likewise, <TT>&quot;o conf KEY splice LIST&quot;</TT> passes the <FONT SIZE="-1">LIST</FONT> to the corresponding
splice command.


<P>


Finally, any other list of arguments is taken as a new list value for
the <FONT SIZE="-1">KEY</FONT> variable discarding the previous value.


<P>


Examples:


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf urllist unshift <A HREF="http://cpan.dev.local/CPAN">http://cpan.dev.local/CPAN</A>
  o conf urllist splice 3 1
  o conf urllist <A HREF="http://cpan1.local">http://cpan1.local</A> <A HREF="http://cpan2.local">http://cpan2.local</A> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.perl.org">ftp://ftp.perl.org</A>

<DT>reverting to saved: o conf defaults<DD>
<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
Reverts all config variables to the state in the saved config file.
<DT>saving the config: o conf commit<DD>
<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
Saves all config variables to the current config file (CPAN/Config.pm

configure alternatives according to the following table:

<H3>Note on the format of the urllist parameter</H3>

<A NAME="ixABV"></A>
urllist parameters are URLs according to <FONT SIZE="-1">RFC</FONT> 1738. We do a little
guessing if your <FONT SIZE="-1">URL</FONT> is not compliant, but if you have problems with
<TT>&quot;file&quot;</TT> URLs, please try the correct format. Either:
<P>



<PRE>
    <A HREF="file://localhost/whatever/ftp/pub/CPAN/">file://localhost/whatever/ftp/pub/CPAN/</A>

</PRE>


<P>

or
<P>



<PRE>
    <A HREF="file:///home/ftp/pub/CPAN/">file:///home/ftp/pub/CPAN/</A>

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The urllist parameter has CD-ROM support</H3>

<A NAME="ixABW"></A>
The <TT>&quot;urllist&quot;</TT> parameter of the configuration table contains a list of
URLs used for downloading. If the list contains any
<TT>&quot;file&quot;</TT> URLs, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> always tries there first. This
feature is disabled for index files. So the recommendation for the
owner of a CD-ROM with <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> contents is: include your local, possibly
outdated CD-ROM as a <TT>&quot;file&quot;</TT> <FONT SIZE="-1">URL</FONT> at the end of urllist, e.g.
<P>



<PRE>
  o conf urllist push <A HREF="file://localhost/CDROM/CPAN">file://localhost/CDROM/CPAN</A>

</PRE>


<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm will then fetch the index files from one of the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> sites
that come at the beginning of urllist. It will later check for each
module to see whether there is a local copy of the most recent version.
<P>

Another peculiarity of urllist is that the site that we could
successfully fetch the last file from automatically gets a preference
token and is tried as the first site for the next request. So if you
add a new site at runtime it may happen that the previously preferred
site will be tried another time. This means that if you want to disallow
a site for the next transfer, it must be explicitly removed from
urllist.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Maintaining the urllist parameter</H3>

<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
If you have <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT>.pm (or some other <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> module configured in
<TT>&quot;yaml_module&quot;</TT>) installed, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm collects a few statistical data
about recent downloads. You can view the statistics with the <TT>&quot;hosts&quot;</TT>
command or inspect them directly by looking into the <TT>&quot;FTPstats.yml&quot;</TT>
file in your <TT>&quot;cpan_home&quot;</TT> directory.
<P>

To get some interesting statistics, it is recommended that
<TT>&quot;randomize_urllist&quot;</TT> be set; this introduces some amount of
randomness into the <FONT SIZE="-1">URL</FONT> selection.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The requires and build_requires dependency declarations</H3>



<A NAME="ixABY"></A>
Since <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm version 1.88_51 modules declared as <TT>&quot;build_requires&quot;</TT> by
a distribution are treated differently depending on the config
variable <TT>&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</TT>. By setting
<TT>&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</TT> to <TT>&quot;no&quot;</TT>, such a module is not 
installed. It is only built and tested, and then kept in the list of
tested but uninstalled modules. As such, it is available during the
build of the dependent module by integrating the path to the
<TT>&quot;blib/arch&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;blib/lib&quot;</TT> directories in the environment variable
<FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5LIB</FONT>. If <TT>&quot;build_requires_install_policy&quot;</TT> is set ti <TT>&quot;yes&quot;</TT>, then
both modules declared as <TT>&quot;requires&quot;</TT> and those declared as
<TT>&quot;build_requires&quot;</TT> are treated alike. By setting to <TT>&quot;ask/yes&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;ask/no&quot;</TT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm asks the user and sets the default accordingly.
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Configuration for individual distributions (<I>Distroprefs</I>)</H3>

<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
(<B>Note:</B> This feature has been introduced in <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm 1.8854 and is
still considered beta quality)
<P>

Distributions on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> usually behave according to what we call the
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mantra. Or since the advent of Module::Build we should talk about
two mantras:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL     perl Build.PL
    make                 ./Build
    make test            ./Build test
    make install         ./Build install

</PRE>


<P>

But some modules cannot be built with this mantra. They try to get
some extra data from the user via the environment, extra arguments, or
interactively---thus disturbing the installation of large bundles like
Phalanx100 or modules with many dependencies like Plagger.
<P>

The distroprefs system of <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> addresses this problem by
allowing the user to specify extra informations and recipes in <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT>
files to either
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
pass additional arguments to one of the four commands,
<DT>*<DD>
set environment variables
<DT>*<DD>
instantiate an Expect object that reads from the console, waits for
some regular expressions and enters some answers
<DT>*<DD>
temporarily override assorted <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> configuration variables
<DT>*<DD>
specify dependencies the original maintainer forgot
<DT>*<DD>
disable the installation of an object altogether
</DL>
<P>

See the <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> and Data::Dumper files that come with the <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT>
distribution in the <TT>&quot;distroprefs/&quot;</TT> directory for examples.
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Filenames</H3>

<A NAME="ixACA"></A>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> files themselves must have the <TT>&quot;.yml&quot;</TT> extension; all other
files are ignored (for two exceptions see <I>Fallback Data::Dumper and
Storable</I> below). The containing directory can be specified in
<TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> in the <TT>&quot;prefs_dir&quot;</TT> config variable. Try <TT>&quot;o conf init
prefs_dir&quot;</TT> in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell to set and activate the distroprefs
system.
<P>

Every <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> file may contain arbitrary documents according to the <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT>
specification, and every document is treated as an entity that
can specify the treatment of a single distribution.
<P>

Filenames can be picked arbitrarily; <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> always reads
all files (in alphabetical order) and takes the key <TT>&quot;match&quot;</TT> (see
below in <I>Language Specs</I>) as a hashref containing match criteria
that determine if the current distribution matches the <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> document
or not.
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Fallback Data::Dumper and Storable</H3>

<A NAME="ixACB"></A>
If neither your configured <TT>&quot;yaml_module&quot;</TT> nor <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT>.pm is installed,
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm falls back to using Data::Dumper and Storable and looks for
files with the extensions <TT>&quot;.dd&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;.st&quot;</TT> in the <TT>&quot;prefs_dir&quot;</TT>
directory. These files are expected to contain one or more hashrefs.
For Data::Dumper generated files, this is expected to be done with by
defining <TT>$VAR1</TT>, <TT>$VAR2</TT>, etc. The <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> shell would produce these
with the command
<P>



<PRE>
    ysh &lt; somefile.yml &gt; somefile.dd

</PRE>


<P>

For Storable files the rule is that they must be constructed such that
<TT>&quot;Storable::retrieve(file)&quot;</TT> returns an array reference and the array
elements represent one distropref object each. The conversion from
<FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> would look like so:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -MYAML=LoadFile -MStorable=nstore -e '
        @y=LoadFile(shift);
        nstore(\@y, shift)' somefile.yml somefile.st

</PRE>


<P>

In bootstrapping situations it is usually sufficient to translate only
a few <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> files to Data::Dumper for crucial modules like
<TT>&quot;YAML::Syck&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;YAML.pm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;Expect.pm&quot;</TT>. If you prefer Storable
over Data::Dumper, remember to pull out a Storable version that writes
an older format than all the other Storable versions that will need to
read them.
<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Blueprint</H3>

<A NAME="ixACC"></A>
The following example contains all supported keywords and structures
with the exception of <TT>&quot;eexpect&quot;</TT> which can be used instead of
<TT>&quot;expect&quot;</TT>.

<DT>goto [string]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACJ"></A>
The canonical name of a delegate distribution to install
instead. Useful when a new version, although it tests <FONT SIZE="-1">OK</FONT> itself,
breaks something else or a developer release or a fork is already
uploaded that is better than the last released version.
<DT>install [hash]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACK"></A>
Processing instructions for the <TT>&quot;make install&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;./Build install&quot;</TT>
phase of the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mantra. See below under <I>Processing Instructions</I>.
<DT>make [hash]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACL"></A>
Processing instructions for the <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;./Build&quot;</TT> phase of the
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mantra. See below under <I>Processing Instructions</I>.
<DT>match [hash]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
A hashref with one or more of the keys <TT>&quot;distribution&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;modules&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;perl&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;perlconfig&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;env&quot;</TT> that specify whether a document is
targeted at a specific <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> distribution or installation.
Keys prefixed with <TT>&quot;not_&quot;</TT> negates the corresponding match.


<P>


The corresponding values are interpreted as regular expressions. The
<TT>&quot;distribution&quot;</TT> related one will be matched against the canonical
distribution name, e.g. ``AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-3.14.tar.gz''.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;module&quot;</TT> related one will be matched against <I>all</I> modules
contained in the distribution until one module matches.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;perl&quot;</TT> related one will be matched against <TT>$^X</TT> (but with the
absolute path).


<P>


The value associated with <TT>&quot;perlconfig&quot;</TT> is itself a hashref that is
matched against corresponding values in the <TT>%Config::Config</TT> hash
living in the <TT>&quot;Config.pm&quot;</TT> module.
Keys prefixed with <TT>&quot;not_&quot;</TT> negates the corresponding match.


<P>


The value associated with <TT>&quot;env&quot;</TT> is itself a hashref that is
matched against corresponding values in the <TT>%ENV</TT> hash.
Keys prefixed with <TT>&quot;not_&quot;</TT> negates the corresponding match.


<P>


If more than one restriction of <TT>&quot;module&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;distribution&quot;</TT>, etc. is
specified, the results of the separately computed match values must
all match. If so, the hashref represented by the
<FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> document is returned as the preference structure for the current
distribution.
<DT>patches [array]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
An array of patches on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> or on the local disk to be applied in
order via an external patch program. If the value for the <TT>&quot;-p&quot;</TT>
parameter is <TT>0</TT> or <TT>1</TT> is determined by reading the patch
beforehand. The path to each patch is either an absolute path on the
local filesystem or relative to a patch directory specified in the
<TT>&quot;patches_dir&quot;</TT> configuration variable or in the format of a canonical
distroname. For examples please consult the distroprefs/ directory in
the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm distribution (these examples are not installed by
default).


<P>


Note: if the <TT>&quot;applypatch&quot;</TT> program is installed and <TT>&quot;CPAN::Config&quot;</TT>
knows about it <B>and</B> a patch is written by the <TT>&quot;makepatch&quot;</TT> program,
then <TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> lets <TT>&quot;applypatch&quot;</TT> apply the patch. Both <TT>&quot;makepatch&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;applypatch&quot;</TT> are available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> in the <TT>&quot;JV/makepatch-*&quot;</TT>
distribution.

<DT>commandline<DD>
<A NAME="ixACS"></A>
A full commandline to run via <TT>&quot;system()&quot;</TT>.
During execution, the environment variable <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL</FONT> is set
to $^X (but with an absolute path). If <TT>&quot;commandline&quot;</TT> is specified,
<TT>&quot;args&quot;</TT> is not used.
<DT>eexpect [hash]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACT"></A>
Extended <TT>&quot;expect&quot;</TT>. This is a hash reference with four allowed keys,
<TT>&quot;mode&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;timeout&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;reuse&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;talk&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<TT>&quot;mode&quot;</TT> may have the values <TT>&quot;deterministic&quot;</TT> for the case where all
questions come in the order written down and <TT>&quot;anyorder&quot;</TT> for the case
where the questions may come in any order. The default mode is
<TT>&quot;deterministic&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<TT>&quot;timeout&quot;</TT> denotes a timeout in seconds. Floating-point timeouts are
<FONT SIZE="-1">OK</FONT>. With <TT>&quot;mode=deterministic&quot;</TT>, the timeout denotes the
timeout per question; with <TT>&quot;mode=anyorder&quot;</TT> it denotes the
timeout per byte received from the stream or questions.


<P>


<TT>&quot;talk&quot;</TT> is a reference to an array that contains alternating questions
and answers. Questions are regular expressions and answers are literal
strings. The Expect module watches the stream from the
execution of the external program (<TT>&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;perl
Build.PL&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT>, etc.).


<P>


For <TT>&quot;mode=deterministic&quot;</TT>, the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm injects the
corresponding answer as soon as the stream matches the regular expression.


<P>


For <TT>&quot;mode=anyorder&quot;</TT> <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm answers a question as soon
as the timeout is reached for the next byte in the input stream. In
this mode you can use the <TT>&quot;reuse&quot;</TT> parameter to decide what will
happen with a question-answer pair after it has been used. In the
default case (reuse=0) it is removed from the array, avoiding being
used again accidentally. If you want to answer the
question <TT>&quot;Do you really want to do that&quot;</TT> several times, then it must
be included in the array at least as often as you want this answer to
be given. Setting the parameter <TT>&quot;reuse&quot;</TT> to 1 makes this repetition
unnecessary.
<DT>env [hash]<DD>
<A NAME="ixACU"></A>

<A NAME="ixACW"></A>
If you have the <TT>&quot;Kwalify&quot;</TT> module installed (which is part of the
Bundle::CPANxxl), then all your distroprefs files are checked for
syntactic correctness.
<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Example Distroprefs Files</H3>

<A NAME="ixACX"></A>
<TT>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</TT> comes with a collection of example <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> files. Note that these
are really just examples and should not be used without care because
they cannot fit everybody's purpose. After all, the authors of the
packages that ask questions had a need to ask, so you should watch
their questions and adjust the examples to your environment and your
needs. You have been warned:-)
<A NAME="lbBG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROGRAMMER'S INTERFACE</H2>

<A NAME="ixACY"></A>
If you do not enter the shell, shell commands are 
available both as methods (<TT>&quot;CPAN::Shell-&gt;install(...)&quot;</TT>) and as
functions in the calling package (<TT>&quot;install(...)&quot;</TT>).  Before calling low-level
commands, it makes sense to initialize components of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> you need, e.g.:
<P>



<PRE>
  CPAN::HandleConfig-&gt;load;
  CPAN::Shell::setup_output;
  CPAN::Index-&gt;reload;

</PRE>


<P>

High-level commands do such initializations automatically.
<P>

There's currently only one class that has a stable interface -
CPAN::Shell. All commands that are available in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell are
methods of the class CPAN::Shell. Each of the commands that produce
listings of modules (<TT>&quot;r&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;autobundle&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;u&quot;</TT>) also return a list of
the IDs of all modules within the list.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>expand($type,@things)<DD>
<A NAME="ixACZ"></A>
The IDs of all objects available within a program are strings that can
be expanded to the corresponding real objects with the
<TT>&quot;CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,@things)&quot;</TT> method. Expand returns a
list of CPAN::Module objects according to the <TT>@things</TT> arguments
given. In scalar context, it returns only the first element of the
list.
<DT>expandany(@things)<DD>
<A NAME="ixADA"></A>
Like expand, but returns objects of the appropriate type, i.e.
CPAN::Bundle objects for bundles, CPAN::Module objects for modules, and
CPAN::Distribution objects for distributions. Note: it does not expand
to CPAN::Author objects.
<DT>Programming Examples<DD>
<A NAME="ixADB"></A>
This enables the programmer to do operations that combine
functionalities that are available in the shell.


<P>




<PRE>
    # install everything that is outdated on my disk:
    perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell-&gt;install(CPAN::Shell-&gt;r)'

    # install my favorite programs if necessary:
    for $mod (qw(Net::FTP Digest::SHA Data::Dumper)) {
        CPAN::Shell-&gt;install($mod);
    }

    # list all modules on my disk that have no VERSION number
    for $mod (CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;/./&quot;)) {

    # find out which distribution on CPAN contains a module:
    print CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;Apache::Constants&quot;)-&gt;cpan_file

</PRE>




<P>


Or if you want to schedule a <I>cron</I> job to watch <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, you could list
all modules that need updating. First a quick and dirty way:


<P>




<PRE>
    perl -e 'use CPAN; CPAN::Shell-&gt;r;'

</PRE>




<P>


If you don't want any output should all modules be
up to date, parse the output of above command for the regular
expression <TT>&quot;/modules are up to date/&quot;</TT> and decide to mail the output
only if it doesn't match.


<P>


If you prefer to do it more in a programmerish style in one single
process, something like this may better suit you:


<P>




<PRE>
  # list all modules on my disk that have newer versions on CPAN
  for $mod (CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;/./&quot;)) {
    next unless $mod-&gt;inst_file;
    next if $mod-&gt;uptodate;
    printf &quot;Module %s is installed as %s, could be updated to %s from CPAN\n&quot;,
        $mod-&gt;id, $mod-&gt;inst_version, $mod-&gt;cpan_version;
  }

</PRE>




<P>


If that gives too much output every day, you may want to
watch only for three modules. You can write


<P>




<PRE>
  for $mod (CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;/Apache|LWP|CGI/&quot;)) {

</PRE>




<P>


as the first line instead. Or you can combine some of the above
tricks:


<P>




<PRE>
  # watch only for a new mod_perl module
  $mod = CPAN::Shell-&gt;expand(&quot;Module&quot;,&quot;mod_perl&quot;);
  exit if $mod-&gt;uptodate;
  # new mod_perl arrived, let me know all update recommendations
  CPAN::Shell-&gt;r;

<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::install()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEG"></A>
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
runs the external command <TT>&quot;make install&quot;</TT> there. If <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> has not
yet been run, it will be run first. A <TT>&quot;make test&quot;</TT> is issued in
any case and if this fails, the install is cancelled. The
cancellation can be avoided by letting <TT>&quot;force&quot;</TT> run the <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> for
you.


<P>


This install method only has the power to install the distribution if
there are no dependencies in the way. To install an object along with all 
its dependencies, use CPAN::Shell-&gt;install.


<P>


Note that <I>install()</I> gives no meaningful return value. See <I>uptodate()</I>.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::install_tested()</I><DD>

<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::isa_perl()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEI"></A>
Returns 1 if this distribution file seems to be a perl distribution.
Normally this is derived from the file name only, but the index from
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> can contain a hint to achieve a return value of true for other
filenames too.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::look()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEJ"></A>
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
opens a subshell there. Exiting the subshell returns.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::make()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEK"></A>
First runs the <TT>&quot;get&quot;</TT> method to make sure the distribution is
downloaded and unpacked. Changes to the directory where the
distribution has been unpacked and runs the external commands <TT>&quot;perl
Makefile.PL&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;perl Build.PL&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> there.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::perldoc()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEL"></A>
Downloads the pod documentation of the file associated with a
distribution (in <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT> format) and runs it through the external
command <I>lynx</I> specified in <TT>&quot;$CPAN::Config-&quot;</TT>{lynx}&gt;. If <I>lynx</I>
isn't available, it converts it to plain text with the external
command <I>html2text</I> and runs it through the pager specified
in <TT>&quot;$CPAN::Config-&quot;</TT>{pager}&gt;
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::prefs()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEM"></A>
Returns the hash reference from the first matching <FONT SIZE="-1">YAML</FONT> file that the
user has deposited in the <TT>&quot;prefs_dir/&quot;</TT> directory. The first
succeeding match wins. The files in the <TT>&quot;prefs_dir/&quot;</TT> are processed
alphabetically, and the canonical distroname (e.g.
AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-3.14.tar.gz) is matched against the regular expressions
stored in the <TT>$root</TT>-&gt;{match}{distribution} attribute value.
Additionally all module names contained in a distribution are matched
against the regular expressions in the <TT>$root</TT>-&gt;{match}{module} attribute
value. The two match values are ANDed together. Each of the two
attributes are optional.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::prereq_pm()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEN"></A>
Returns the hash reference that has been announced by a distribution
as the <TT>&quot;requires&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;build_requires&quot;</TT> elements. These can be
declared either by the <TT>&quot;META.yml&quot;</TT> (if authoritative) or can be
deposited after the run of <TT>&quot;Build.PL&quot;</TT> in the file <TT>&quot;./_build/prereqs&quot;</TT>
or after the run of <TT>&quot;Makfile.PL&quot;</TT> written as the <TT>&quot;PREREQ_PM&quot;</TT> hash in
a comment in the produced <TT>&quot;Makefile&quot;</TT>. <I>Note</I>: this method only works
after an attempt has been made to <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> the distribution. Returns
undef otherwise.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::readme()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEO"></A>
Downloads the <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT> file associated with a distribution and runs it
through the pager specified in <TT>&quot;$CPAN::Config-&quot;</TT>{pager}&gt;.

<A NAME="ixAEP"></A>
Downloads report data for this distribution from <A HREF="http://www.cpantesters.org">www.cpantesters.org</A>
and displays a subset of them.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::read_yaml()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEQ"></A>
Returns the content of the <FONT SIZE="-1">META</FONT>.yml of this distro as a hashref. Note:
works only after an attempt has been made to <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> the distribution.
Returns undef otherwise. Also returns undef if the content of <FONT SIZE="-1">META</FONT>.yml
is not authoritative. (The rules about what exactly makes the content
authoritative are still in flux.)
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::test()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAER"></A>
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
runs <TT>&quot;make test&quot;</TT> there.
<DT><I>CPAN::Distribution::uptodate()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAES"></A>
Returns 1 if all the modules contained in the distribution are
uptodate. Relies on containsmods.
<DT><I>CPAN::Index::force_reload()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAET"></A>
Forces a reload of all indices.
<DT><I>CPAN::Index::reload()</I><DD>

<DT><I>CPAN::InfoObj::dump()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEV"></A>
CPAN::Author, CPAN::Bundle, CPAN::Module, and CPAN::Distribution
inherit this method. It prints the data structure associated with an

internal and thus subject to change without notice.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::as_glimpse()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEW"></A>
Returns a one-line description of the module in four columns: The
first column contains the word <TT>&quot;Module&quot;</TT>, the second column consists
of one character: an equals sign if this module is already installed
and uptodate, a less-than sign if this module is installed but can be
upgraded, and a space if the module is not installed. The third column
is the name of the module and the fourth column gives maintainer or
distribution information.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::as_string()</I><DD>

<DT>CPAN::Module::force($method,@args)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFF"></A>
Forces <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> to perform a task it would normally refuse to
do. Force takes as arguments a method name to be invoked and any number
of additional arguments to pass that method.
The internals of the object get the needed changes so that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm
does not refuse to take the action. See also the section above on the
<TT>&quot;force&quot;</TT> and the <TT>&quot;fforce&quot;</TT> pragma.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::get()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFG"></A>
Runs a get on the distribution associated with this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::inst_file()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFH"></A>
Returns the filename of the module found in <TT>@INC</TT>. The first file found
is reported, just as perl itself stops searching <TT>@INC</TT> once it finds a
module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::available_file()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFI"></A>
Returns the filename of the module found in <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5LIB</FONT> or <TT>@INC</TT>. The
first file found is reported. The advantage of this method over
<TT>&quot;inst_file&quot;</TT> is that modules that have been tested but not yet
installed are included because <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5LIB</FONT> keeps track of tested modules.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::inst_version()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFJ"></A>
Returns the version number of the installed module in readable format.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::available_version()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFK"></A>
Returns the version number of the available module in readable format.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::install()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFL"></A>
Runs an <TT>&quot;install&quot;</TT> on the distribution associated with this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::look()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFM"></A>
Changes to the directory where the distribution associated with this
module has been unpacked and opens a subshell there. Exiting the
subshell returns.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::make()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFN"></A>
Runs a <TT>&quot;make&quot;</TT> on the distribution associated with this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::manpage_headline()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFO"></A>
If module is installed, peeks into the module's manpage, reads the
headline, and returns it. Moreover, if the module has been downloaded
within this session, does the equivalent on the downloaded module even
if it hasn't been installed yet.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::perldoc()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFP"></A>
Runs a <TT>&quot;perldoc&quot;</TT> on this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::readme()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFQ"></A>
Runs a <TT>&quot;readme&quot;</TT> on the distribution associated with this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::reports()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFR"></A>
Calls the <I>reports()</I> method on the associated distribution object.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::test()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFS"></A>
Runs a <TT>&quot;test&quot;</TT> on the distribution associated with this module.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::uptodate()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFT"></A>
Returns 1 if the module is installed and up-to-date.
<DT><I>CPAN::Module::userid()</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFU"></A>
Returns the author's <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> of the module.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbBI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Cache Manager</H3>

<A NAME="ixAFV"></A>
Currently the cache manager only keeps track of the build directory
($CPAN::Config-&gt;{build_dir}). It is a simple <FONT SIZE="-1">FIFO</FONT> mechanism that
deletes complete directories below <TT>&quot;build_dir&quot;</TT> as soon as the size of
all directories there gets bigger than <TT>$CPAN::Config</TT>-&gt;{build_cache}
(in <FONT SIZE="-1">MB</FONT>). The contents of this cache may be used for later
re-installations that you intend to do manually, but will never be
trusted by <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> itself. This is due to the fact that the user might
use these directories for building modules on different architectures.
<P>

There is another directory ($CPAN::Config-&gt;{keep_source_where}) where
the original distribution files are kept. This directory is not
covered by the cache manager and must be controlled by the user. If
you choose to have the same directory as build_dir and as
keep_source_where directory, then your sources will be deleted with
the same fifo mechanism.
<A NAME="lbBJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Bundles</H3>

<A NAME="ixAFW"></A>
A bundle is just a perl module in the namespace Bundle:: that does not
define any functions or methods. It usually only contains documentation.
<P>

It starts like a perl module with a package declaration and a <TT>$VERSION</TT>
variable. After that the pod section looks like any other pod with the
only difference being that <I>one special pod section</I> exists starting with
(verbatim):
<P>



<PRE>
    =head1 CONTENTS

</PRE>


<P>

In this pod section each line obeys the format
<P>



<PRE>
        Module_Name [Version_String] [- optional text]

</PRE>


<P>

The only required part is the first field, the name of a module
(e.g. Foo::Bar, ie. <I>not</I> the name of the distribution file). The rest
of the line is optional. The comment part is delimited by a dash just
as in the man page header.
<P>

The distribution of a bundle should follow the same convention as
other distributions.
<P>

Bundles are treated specially in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> package. If you say 'install
Bundle::Tkkit' (assuming such a bundle exists), <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> will install all
the modules in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CONTENTS</FONT> section of the pod. You can install your
own Bundles locally by placing a conformant Bundle file somewhere into
your <TT>@INC</TT> path. The <I>autobundle()</I> command which is available in the
shell interface does that for you by including all currently installed
modules in a snapshot bundle file.
<A NAME="lbBK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PREREQUISITES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAFX"></A>
If you have a local mirror of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> and can access all files with
``file:'' URLs, then you only need a perl later than perl5.003 to run
this module. Otherwise Net::FTP is strongly recommended. <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT> may be
required for non-UNIX systems, or if your nearest <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> site is
associated with a <FONT SIZE="-1">URL</FONT> that is not <TT>&quot;ftp:&quot;</TT>.
<P>

If you have neither Net::FTP nor <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT>, there is a fallback mechanism
implemented for an external ftp command or for an external lynx
command.

<A NAME="ixAFY"></A>
<A NAME="lbBM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Finding packages and <FONT SIZE="-1">VERSION</FONT></H3>

<A NAME="ixAFZ"></A>
This module presumes that all packages on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
declare their <TT>$VERSION</TT> variable in an easy to parse manner. This
prerequisite can hardly be relaxed because it consumes far too much
memory to load all packages into the running program just to determine
the <TT>$VERSION</TT> variable. Currently all programs that are dealing with
version use something like this


<P>




<PRE>
    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le \
        'print MM-&gt;parse_version(shift)' filename

</PRE>




<P>


If you are author of a package and wonder if your <TT>$VERSION</TT> can be
parsed, please try the above method.
<DT>*<DD>
come as compressed or gzipped tarfiles or as zip files and contain a
<TT>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Build.PL&quot;</TT> (well, we try to handle a bit more, but
with little enthusiasm).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbBN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Debugging</H3>

<A NAME="ixAGA"></A>
Debugging this module is more than a bit complex due to interference from
the software producing the indices on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, the mirroring process on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>,
packaging, configuration, synchronicity, and even (gasp!) due to bugs
within the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm module itself.
<P>

For debugging the code of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm itself in interactive mode, some 
debugging aid can be turned on for most packages within
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm with one of
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>o debug package...<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGB"></A>
sets debug mode for packages.
<DT>o debug -package...<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGC"></A>
unsets debug mode for packages.
<DT>o debug all<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGD"></A>
turns debugging on for all packages.
<DT>o debug number<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGE"></A>
</DL>
<P>

which sets the debugging packages directly. Note that <TT>&quot;o debug 0&quot;</TT>
turns debugging off.
<P>

What seems a successful strategy is the combination of <TT>&quot;reload
cpan&quot;</TT> and the debugging switches. Add a new debug statement while
running in the shell and then issue a <TT>&quot;reload cpan&quot;</TT> and see the new
debugging messages immediately without losing the current context.
<P>

<TT>&quot;o debug&quot;</TT> without an argument lists the valid package names and the
current set of packages in debugging mode. <TT>&quot;o debug&quot;</TT> has built-in
completion support.
<P>

For debugging of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> data there is the <TT>&quot;dump&quot;</TT> command which takes
the same arguments as make/test/install and outputs each object's
Data::Dumper dump. If an argument looks like a perl variable and
contains one of <TT>&quot;$&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;%&quot;</TT>, it is <I>eval()</I>ed and fed to
Data::Dumper directly.
<A NAME="lbBO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Floppy, Zip, Offline Mode</H3>

<A NAME="ixAGF"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm works nicely without network access, too. If you maintain machines
that are not networked at all, you should consider working with <TT>&quot;file:&quot;</TT>
URLs. You'll have to collect your modules somewhere first. So
you might use <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm to put together all you need on a networked
machine. Then copy the <TT>$CPAN::Config</TT>-&gt;{keep_source_where} (but not
<TT>$CPAN::Config</TT>-&gt;{build_dir}) directory on a floppy. This floppy is kind
of a personal <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm on the non-networked machines works nicely
with this floppy. See also below the paragraph about CD-ROM support.

<A NAME="ixAGG"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>has_inst($module)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGH"></A>
Returns true if the module is installed. Used to load all modules into
the running <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm that are considered optional. The config variable
<TT>&quot;dontload_list&quot;</TT> intercepts the <TT>&quot;has_inst()&quot;</TT> call such
that an optional module is not loaded despite being available. For
example, the following command will prevent <TT>&quot;YAML.pm&quot;</TT> from being
loaded:


<P>

See the source for details.
<DT>has_usable($module)<DD>

Returns true if the module is installed and in a usable state. Only
useful for a handful of modules that are used internally. See the
source for details.
<DT>instance($module)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGJ"></A>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbBQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY</H2>

<A NAME="ixAGK"></A>
There's no strong security layer in <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm helps you to
install foreign, unmasked, unsigned code on your machine. We compare
to a checksum that comes from the net just as the distribution file
itself. But we try to make it easy to add security on demand:
<A NAME="lbBR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Cryptographically signed modules</H3>

<A NAME="ixAGL"></A>
Since release 1.77, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm has been able to verify cryptographically
signed module distributions using Module::Signature.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> modules
can be signed by their authors, thus giving more security.  The simple
unsigned <FONT SIZE="-1">MD5</FONT> checksums that were used before by <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> protect mainly
against accidental file corruption.
<P>

You will need to have Module::Signature installed, which in turn
requires that you have at least one of Crypt::OpenPGP module or the
command-line <I>gpg</I> tool installed.
<P>

You will also need to be able to connect over the Internet to the public
keyservers, like pgp.mit.edu, and their port 11731 (the <FONT SIZE="-1">HKP</FONT> protocol).
<P>

The configuration parameter check_sigs is there to turn signature
checking on or off.
<A NAME="lbBS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXPORT</H2>

<A NAME="ixAGM"></A>
Most functions in package <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> are exported by default. The reason
for this is that the primary use is intended for the cpan shell or for
one-liners.
<A NAME="lbBT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<A NAME="ixAGN"></A>
When the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell enters a subshell via the look command, it sets
the environment <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL</FONT> to 1, or increments that variable if it is
already set.
<P>

When <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> runs, it sets the environment variable <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING</FONT>
to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> of the running process. It also sets
<FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING</FONT> to prevent runaway processes which could
happen with older versions of Module::Install.
<P>

When running <TT>&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</TT>, the environment variable
<TT>&quot;PERL5_CPAN_IS_EXECUTING&quot;</TT> is set to the full path of the
<TT>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</TT> that is being executed. This prevents runaway processes
with newer versions of Module::Install.
<P>

When the config variable ftp_passive is set, all downloads will be run
with the environment variable <FONT SIZE="-1">FTP_PASSIVE</FONT> set to this value. This is
in general a good idea as it influences both Net::FTP and <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT> based
connections. The same effect can be achieved by starting the cpan
shell with this environment variable set. For Net::FTP alone, one can
also always set passive mode by running libnetcfg.
<A NAME="lbBU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POPULATE AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES</H2>

<A NAME="ixAGO"></A>
Populating a freshly installed perl with one's favorite modules is pretty
easy if you maintain a private bundle definition file. To get a useful
blueprint of a bundle definition file, the command autobundle can be used
on the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell command line. This command writes a bundle definition
file for all modules installed for the current perl
interpreter. It's recommended to run this command once only, and from then
on maintain the file manually under a private name, say
Bundle/my_bundle.pm. With a clever bundle file you can then simply say
<P>



<PRE>
    cpan&gt; install Bundle::my_bundle

</PRE>


<P>

then answer a few questions and go out for coffee (possibly
even in a different city).
<P>

Maintaining a bundle definition file means keeping track of two
things: dependencies and interactivity. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm sometimes fails on
calculating dependencies because not all modules define all MakeMaker
attributes correctly, so a bundle definition file should specify
prerequisites as early as possible. On the other hand, it's 
annoying that so many distributions need some interactive configuring. So
what you can try to accomplish in your private bundle file is to have the
packages that need to be configured early in the file and the gentle
ones later, so you can go out for cofeee after a few minutes and leave <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm
to churn away untended.
<A NAME="lbBV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WORKING WITH CPAN.pm BEHIND FIREWALLS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAGP"></A>
Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing the following paragraphs about
the interaction between perl, and various firewall configurations. For
further information on firewalls, it is recommended to consult the
documentation that comes with the <I>ncftp</I> program. If you are unable to
go through the firewall with a simple Perl setup, it is likely
that you can configure <I>ncftp</I> so that it works through your firewall.
<A NAME="lbBW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Three basic types of firewalls</H3>

<A NAME="ixAGQ"></A>
Firewalls can be categorized into three basic types.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>http firewall<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGR"></A>
This is when the firewall machine runs a web server, and to access the
outside world, you must do so via that web server. If you set environment
variables like http_proxy or ftp_proxy to values beginning with <A HREF="http://,">http://,</A>
or in your web browser you've proxy information set, then you know
you are running behind an http firewall.


<P>


To access servers outside these types of firewalls with perl (even for
ftp), you need <FONT SIZE="-1">LWP</FONT>.
<DT>ftp firewall<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGS"></A>
This where the firewall machine runs an ftp server. This kind of
firewall will only let you access ftp servers outside the firewall.
This is usually done by connecting to the firewall with ftp, then
entering a username like ``<A HREF="mailto:user@outside.host.com">user@outside.host.com</A>''.


<P>


To access servers outside these type of firewalls with perl, you
need Net::FTP.
<DT>One-way visibility<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGT"></A>
One-way visibility means these firewalls try to make themselves 
invisible to users inside the firewall. An <FONT SIZE="-1">FTP</FONT> data connection is
normally created by sending your <FONT SIZE="-1">IP</FONT> address to the remote server and then
listening for the return connection. But the remote server will not be able to
connect to you because of the firewall. For these types of firewall,
<FONT SIZE="-1">FTP</FONT> connections need to be done in a passive mode.


<P>


There are two that I can think off.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">SOCKS</FONT><DD>
<A NAME="ixAGU"></A>
If you are using a <FONT SIZE="-1">SOCKS</FONT> firewall, you will need to compile perl and link
it with the <FONT SIZE="-1">SOCKS</FONT> library.  This is what is normally called a 'socksified'
perl. With this executable you will be able to connect to servers outside
the firewall as if it were not there.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1">IP</FONT> Masquerade<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGV"></A>
This is when the firewall implemented in the kernel (via <FONT SIZE="-1">NAT</FONT>, or networking
address translation), it allows you to hide a complete network behind one
<FONT SIZE="-1">IP</FONT> address. With this firewall no special compiling is needed as you can
access hosts directly.


<P>


For accessing ftp servers behind such firewalls you usually need to
set the environment variable <TT>&quot;FTP_PASSIVE&quot;</TT> or the config variable
ftp_passive to a true value.

<H3>Configuring lynx or ncftp for going through a firewall</H3>

If you can go through your firewall with e.g. lynx, presumably with a
command such as
<P>



<PRE>
    /usr/local/bin/lynx -pscott:tiger

then you would configure <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm with the command
<P>



<PRE>
    o conf lynx &quot;/usr/local/bin/lynx -pscott:tiger&quot;

</PRE>


<P>

That's all. Similarly for ncftp or ftp, you would configure something
like

<A NAME="ixAGY"></A>
I installed a new version of module X but <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> keeps saying,
I have the old version installed


<P>


Probably you <B>do</B> have the old version installed. This can
happen if a module installs itself into a different directory in the
<TT>@INC</TT> path than it was previously installed. This is not really a
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm problem, you would have the same problem when installing the
module manually. The easiest way to prevent this behaviour is to add
the argument <TT>&quot;UNINST=1&quot;</TT> to the <TT>&quot;make install&quot;</TT> call, and that is why
many people add this argument permanently by configuring


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1

</PRE>


<DT>2)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAGZ"></A>
So why is UNINST=1 not the default?


<P>


Because there are people who have their precise expectations about who
may install where in the <TT>@INC</TT> path and who uses which <TT>@INC</TT> array. In
fine tuned environments <TT>&quot;UNINST=1&quot;</TT> can cause damage.
<DT>3)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHA"></A>
I want to clean up my mess, and install a new perl along with
all modules I have. How do I go about it?


<P>


Run the autobundle command for your old perl and optionally rename the
resulting bundle file (e.g. Bundle/mybundle.pm), install the new perl
with the Configure option prefix, e.g.


<P>




<PRE>
    ./Configure -Dprefix=/usr/local/perl-5.6.78.9

</PRE>




<P>


Install the bundle file you produced in the first step with something like


<P>




<PRE>
    cpan&gt; install Bundle::mybundle

</PRE>




<P>


and you're done.
<DT>4)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHB"></A>
When I install bundles or multiple modules with one command

<A NAME="ixAHC"></A>
I am not root, how can I install a module in a personal directory?


<P>


First of all, you will want to use your own configuration, not the one
that your root user installed. If you do not have permission to write
in the cpan directory that root has configured, you will be asked if
you want to create your own config. Answering ``yes'' will bring you into
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>'s configuration stage, using the system config for all defaults except
things that have to do with <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>'s work directory, saving your choices to
your MyConfig.pm file.


<P>


You can also manually initiate this process with the following command:


<P>




<PRE>
    % perl -MCPAN -e 'mkmyconfig'

</PRE>




<P>


or by running


<P>




<PRE>
    mkmyconfig

</PRE>




<P>


from the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell.


<P>


You will most probably also want to configure something like this:


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf makepl_arg &quot;LIB=~/myperl/lib \
                    INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 \
                    INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3 \
                    INSTALLSCRIPT=~/myperl/bin \
                    INSTALLBIN=~/myperl/bin&quot;

</PRE>




<P>


and then the equivalent command for Module::Build, which is


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf mbuildpl_arg &quot;--lib=~/myperl/lib \
                    --installman1dir=~/myperl/man/man1 \
                    --installman3dir=~/myperl/man/man3 \
                    --installscript=~/myperl/bin \
                    --installbin=~/myperl/bin&quot;

</PRE>




<P>


You can make this setting permanent like all <TT>&quot;o conf&quot;</TT> settings with
<TT>&quot;o conf commit&quot;</TT> or by setting <TT>&quot;auto_commit&quot;</TT> beforehand.


<P>


You will have to add ~/myperl/man to the <FONT SIZE="-1">MANPATH</FONT> environment variable
and also tell your perl programs to look into ~/myperl/lib, e.g. by
including


<P>




<PRE>
  use lib &quot;$ENV{HOME}/myperl/lib&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


or setting the <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5LIB</FONT> environment variable.


<P>


While we're speaking about <TT>$ENV</TT>{<FONT SIZE="-1">HOME</FONT>}, it might be worth mentioning,
that for Windows we use the File::HomeDir module that provides an
equivalent to the concept of the home directory on Unix.


<P>


Another thing you should bear in mind is that the <FONT SIZE="-1">UNINST</FONT> parameter can
be dangerous when you are installing into a private area because you
might accidentally remove modules that other people depend on that are
not using the private area.

How to get a package, unwrap it, and make a change before building it?


<P>


Have a look at the <TT>&quot;look&quot;</TT> (!) command.
<DT>7)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHE"></A>
I installed a Bundle and had a couple of fails. When I
retried, everything resolved nicely. Can this be fixed to work
on first try?


<P>


The reason for this is that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> does not know the dependencies of all
modules when it starts out. To decide about the additional items to
install, it just uses data found in the <FONT SIZE="-1">META</FONT>.yml file or the generated
Makefile. An undetected missing piece breaks the process. But it may
well be that your Bundle installs some prerequisite later than some
depending item and thus your second try is able to resolve everything.
Please note, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm does not know the dependency tree in advance and
cannot sort the queue of things to install in a topologically correct
order. It resolves perfectly well <B>if</B> all modules declare the
prerequisites correctly with the <FONT SIZE="-1">PREREQ_PM</FONT> attribute to MakeMaker or
the <TT>&quot;requires&quot;</TT> stanza of Module::Build. For bundles which fail and
you need to install often, it is recommended to sort the Bundle
definition file manually.
<DT>8)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHF"></A>
In our intranet, we have many modules for internal use. How
can I integrate these modules with <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm but without uploading
the modules to <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>?


<P>


Have a look at the CPAN::Site module.
<DT>9)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHG"></A>
When I run <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>'s shell, I get an error message about things in my
<TT>&quot;/etc/inputrc&quot;</TT> (or <TT>&quot;~/.inputrc&quot;</TT>) file.


<P>


These are readline issues and can only be fixed by studying readline
configuration on your architecture and adjusting the referenced file
accordingly. Please make a backup of the <TT>&quot;/etc/inputrc&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;~/.inputrc&quot;</TT>
and edit them. Quite often harmless changes like uppercasing or
lowercasing some arguments solves the problem.
<DT>10)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHH"></A>
Some authors have strange characters in their names.


<P>


Internally <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm uses the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> charset. If your terminal is
expecting <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO-8859-1</FONT> charset, a converter can be activated by setting
term_is_latin to a true value in your config file. One way of doing so
would be


<P>




<PRE>
    cpan&gt; o conf term_is_latin 1

</PRE>




<P>


If other charset support is needed, please file a bugreport against
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm at rt.cpan.org and describe your needs. Maybe we can extend
the support or maybe <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> terminals become widely available.


<P>


Note: this config variable is deprecated and will be removed in a
future version of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm. It will be replaced with the conventions
around the family of <TT>$LANG</TT> and <TT>$LC_</TT>* environment variables.
<DT>11)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHI"></A>
When an install fails for some reason and then I correct the error
condition and retry, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm refuses to install the module, saying
<TT>&quot;Already tried without success&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Use the force pragma like so


<P>




<PRE>
  force install Foo::Bar

</PRE>




<P>


Or you can use


<P>




<PRE>
  look Foo::Bar

</PRE>




<P>


and then <TT>&quot;make install&quot;</TT> directly in the subshell.

How do I install a ``<FONT SIZE="-1">DEVELOPER</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">RELEASE</FONT>'' of a module?


<P>


By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> will install the latest non-developer release of a
module. If you want to install a dev release, you have to specify the
partial path starting with the author id to the tarball you wish to
install, like so:


<P>




<PRE>
    cpan&gt; install KWILLIAMS/Module-Build-0.27_07.tar.gz

</PRE>




<P>


Note that you can use the <TT>&quot;ls&quot;</TT> command to get this path listed.

<A NAME="ixAHK"></A>
How do I install a module and all its dependencies from the commandline,
without being prompted for anything, despite my <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> configuration
(or lack thereof)?


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker's <I>prompt()</I> function to ask its questions, so
if you set the <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT</FONT> environment variable, you shouldn't be
asked any questions at all (assuming the modules you are installing are
nice about obeying that variable as well):


<P>




<PRE>
    % PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'install My::Module'

</PRE>

I'm frequently irritated with the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell's inability to help me
select a good mirror.


<P>


The urllist config parameter is yours. You can add and remove sites at
will. You should find out which sites have the best uptodateness,
bandwidth, reliability, etc. and are topologically close to you. Some
people prefer fast downloads, others uptodateness, others reliability.
You decide which to try in which order.


<P>


Henk P. Penning maintains a site that collects data about <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> sites:


<P>

  <A HREF="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/henkp/mirmon/cpan.html">http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/henkp/mirmon/cpan.html</A>

</PRE>




<P>


Also, feel free to play with experimental features. Run


<P>




<PRE>
  o conf init randomize_urllist ftpstats_period ftpstats_size

</PRE>




<P>


and choose your favorite parameters. After a few downloads running the
<TT>&quot;hosts&quot;</TT> command will probably assist you in choosing the best mirror
sites.

<A NAME="ixAHN"></A>
Why do I get asked the same questions every time I start the shell?


<P>


You can make your configuration changes permanent by calling the
command <TT>&quot;o conf commit&quot;</TT>. Alternatively set the <TT>&quot;auto_commit&quot;</TT>
variable to true by running <TT>&quot;o conf init auto_commit&quot;</TT> and answering
the following question with yes.
<DT>17)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHO"></A>
Older versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm had the original root directory of all
tarballs in the build directory. Now there are always random
characters appended to these directory names. Why was this done?


<P>


The random characters are provided by File::Temp and ensure that each
module's individual build directory is unique. This makes running
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm in concurrent processes simultaneously safe.
<DT>18)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAHP"></A>
Speaking of the build directory. Do I have to clean it up myself?


<P>


You have the choice to set the config variable <TT>&quot;scan_cache&quot;</TT> to
<TT>&quot;never&quot;</TT>. Then you must clean it up yourself. The other possible
value, <TT>&quot;atstart&quot;</TT> only cleans up the build directory when you start
the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell. If you never start up the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> shell, you probably
also have to clean up the build directory yourself.

<A NAME="ixAHR"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm is regularly tested to run under 5.004, 5.005, and assorted
newer versions. It is getting more and more difficult to get the
minimal prerequisites working on older perls. It is close to
impossible to get the whole Bundle::CPAN working there. If you're in
the position to have only these old versions, be advised that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> is
designed to work fine without the Bundle::CPAN installed.
<P>

To get things going, note that GBARR/Scalar-List-Utils-1.18.tar.gz is
compatible with ancient perls and that File::Temp is listed as a
prerequisite but <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> has reasonable workarounds if it is missing.
<A NAME="lbCB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3><FONT SIZE="-1">CPANPLUS</FONT></H3>

<A NAME="ixAHS"></A>
This module and its competitor, the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPANPLUS</FONT> module, are both much
cooler than the other. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm is older. <FONT SIZE="-1">CPANPLUS</FONT> was designed to be
more modular, but it was never intended to be compatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.pm.
