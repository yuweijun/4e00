<H2>NAME</H2>

B::Xref - Generates cross reference reports for Perl programs
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] foo.pl
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The B::Xref module is used to generate a cross reference listing of all
definitions and uses of variables, subroutines and formats in a Perl program.
It is implemented as a backend for the Perl compiler.
<P>

The report generated is in the following format:
<P>



<PRE>
    File filename1
      Subroutine subname1
        Package package1
          object1        line numbers
          object2        line numbers
          ...
        Package package2
        ...

</PRE>


<P>

Each <B>File</B> section reports on a single file. Each <B>Subroutine</B> section
reports on a single subroutine apart from the special cases
``(definitions)'' and ``(main)''. These report, respectively, on subroutine
definitions found by the initial symbol table walk and on the main part of
the program or module external to all subroutines.
<P>

The report is then grouped by the <B>Package</B> of each variable,
subroutine or format with the special case ``(lexicals)'' meaning
lexical variables. Each <B>object</B> name (implicitly qualified by its
containing <B>Package</B>) includes its type character(s) at the beginning
where possible. Lexical variables are easier to track and even
included dereferencing information where possible.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;line numbers&quot;</TT> are a comma separated list of line numbers (some
preceded by code letters) where that object is used in some way.
Simple uses aren't preceded by a code letter. Introductions (such as
where a lexical is first defined with <TT>&quot;my&quot;</TT>) are indicated with the
letter ``i''. Subroutine and method calls are indicated by the character
``&amp;''.  Subroutine definitions are indicated by ``s'' and format
definitions by ``f''.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
Option words are separated by commas (not whitespace) and follow the
usual conventions of compiler backend options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-oFILENAME<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
Directs output to <TT>&quot;FILENAME&quot;</TT> instead of standard output.
<DT>-r<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Raw output. Instead of producing a human-readable report, outputs a line
in machine-readable form for each definition/use of a variable/sub/format.
<DT>-d<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Don't output the ``(definitions)'' sections.
<DT>-D[tO]<DD>


<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
(Internal) debug options, probably only useful if <TT>&quot;-r&quot;</TT> included.
The <TT>&quot;t&quot;</TT> option prints the object on the top of the stack as it's
being tracked. The <TT>&quot;O&quot;</TT> option prints each operator as it's being
processed in the execution order of the program.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Non-lexical variables are quite difficult to track through a program.
Sometimes the type of a non-lexical variable's use is impossible to
determine. Introductions of non-lexical non-scalars don't seem to be
reported properly.
