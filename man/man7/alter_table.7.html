<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>ALTER TABLE</B> changes the definition of an existing table.
There are several subforms:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ADD COLUMN</B><DD>
This form adds a new column to the table, using the same syntax as
CREATE TABLE [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+create_table">create_table</A></B>(7)].
<DT><B>DROP COLUMN</B><DD>
This form drops a column from a table. Indexes and
table constraints involving the column will be automatically
dropped as well. You will need to say CASCADE if
anything outside the table depends on the column, for example,
foreign key references or views.
<DT><B>SET DATA TYPE</B><DD>
This form changes the type of a column of a table. Indexes and
simple table constraints involving the column will be automatically
converted to use the new column type by reparsing the originally
supplied expression. The optional USING
clause specifies how to compute the new column value from the old;
if omitted, the default conversion is the same as an assignment
cast from old data type to new. A USING
clause must be provided if there is no implicit or assignment
cast from old to new type.
<DT><B>SET/DROP DEFAULT</B><DD>
These forms set or remove the default value for a column.
The default values only apply to subsequent <B>INSERT</B>
commands; they do not cause rows already in the table to change.
Defaults can also be created for views, in which case they are
inserted into <B>INSERT</B> statements on the view before
the view's ON INSERT rule is applied.
<DT><B>SET/DROP NOT NULL</B><DD>
These forms change whether a column is marked to allow null
values or to reject null values. You can only use SET
NOT NULL when the column contains no null values.
<DT><B>SET STATISTICS</B><DD>
This form
sets the per-column statistics-gathering target for subsequent
ANALYZE [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+analyze">analyze</A></B>(7)] operations.
The target can be set in the range 0 to 10000; alternatively, set it
to -1 to revert to using the system default statistics
target (default_statistics_target).
For more information on the use of statistics by the
PostgreSQL query planner, refer to
in the documentation.
<P>
<DT><B>SET STORAGE</B><DD>
This form sets the storage mode for a column. This controls whether this
column is held inline or in a secondary TOAST table, and
whether the data
should be compressed or not. PLAIN must be used
for fixed-length values such as <B>integer</B> and is
inline, uncompressed. MAIN is for inline,
compressible data. EXTERNAL is for external,
uncompressed data, and EXTENDED is for external,
compressed data. EXTENDED is the default for most
data types that support non-PLAIN storage.
Use of EXTERNAL will make substring operations on
very large <B>text</B> and <B>bytea</B> values run faster,
at the penalty of increased storage space. Note that
SET STORAGE doesn't itself change anything in the table,
it just sets the strategy to be pursued during future table updates.
See in the documentation for more information.
<DT><B>ADD </B><I>table_constraint</I><B></B><DD>
This form adds a new constraint to a table using the same syntax as
CREATE TABLE [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+create_table">create_table</A></B>(7)].
<DT><B>DROP CONSTRAINT</B><DD>
This form drops the specified constraint on a table.
<DT><B>DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER</B><DD>
These forms configure the firing of trigger(s) belonging to the table.
A disabled trigger is still known to the system, but is not executed
when its triggering event occurs. For a deferred trigger, the enable
status is checked when the event occurs, not when the trigger function
is actually executed. One can disable or enable a single
trigger specified by name, or all triggers on the table, or only
user triggers (this option excludes triggers that are used to implement
foreign key constraints). Disabling or enabling constraint triggers
requires superuser privileges; it should be done with caution since
of course the integrity of the constraint cannot be guaranteed if the
triggers are not executed.
The trigger firing mechanism is also affected by the configuration
variable session_replication_role. Simply enabled
triggers will fire when the replication role is ``origin''
(the default) or ``local''. Triggers configured as ENABLE
REPLICA will only fire if the session is in ``replica''
mode, and triggers configured as ENABLE ALWAYS will
fire regardless of the current replication mode.
<DT><B>DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] RULE</B><DD>
These forms configure the firing of rewrite rules belonging to the table.
A disabled rule is still known to the system, but is not applied
during query rewriting. The semantics are as for disabled/enabled
triggers. This configuration is ignored for ON SELECT rules, which
are always applied in order to keep views working even if the current
session is in a non-default replication role.
<DT><B>CLUSTER</B><DD>
This form selects the default index for future
CLUSTER [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+cluster">cluster</A></B>(7)]
operations. It does not actually re-cluster the table.
<DT><B>SET WITHOUT CLUSTER</B><DD>
This form removes the most recently used
CLUSTER [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+cluster">cluster</A></B>(7)]
index specification from the table. This affects
future cluster operations that don't specify an index.
<DT><B>SET WITH OIDS</B><DD>
This form adds an oid system column to the
table (see in the documentation).
It does nothing if the table already has OIDs.
<P>
Note that this is not equivalent to ADD COLUMN oid oid;
that would add a normal column that happened to be named
oid, not a system column.
<DT><B>SET WITHOUT OIDS</B><DD>
This form removes the oid system column from the
table. This is exactly equivalent to
DROP COLUMN oid RESTRICT,
except that it will not complain if there is already no
oid column.
<DT><B>SET ( </B><I>storage_parameter</I><B> = </B><I>value</I><B> [, ... ] )</B><DD>
This form changes one or more storage parameters for the table. See
Storage Parameters [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+create_table">create_table</A></B>(7)]
for details on the available parameters. Note that the table contents
will not be modified immediately by this command; depending on the
parameter you might need to rewrite the table to get the desired effects.
That can be done with CLUSTER [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+cluster">cluster</A></B>(7)] or one of the forms of <B>ALTER
TABLE</B> that forces a table rewrite.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Note:</B>

While <B>CREATE TABLE</B> allows OIDS to be specified
in the WITH (<I>storage_parameter</I>) syntax,
<B>ALTER TABLE</B> does not treat OIDS as a
storage parameter. Instead use the SET WITH OIDS
and SET WITHOUT OIDS forms to change OID status.
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>RESET ( </B><I>storage_parameter</I><B> [, ... ] )</B><DD>
This form resets one or more storage parameters to their
defaults. As with SET, a table rewrite might be
needed to update the table entirely.
<DT><B>INHERIT </B><I>parent_table</I><B></B><DD>
This form adds the target table as a new child of the specified parent
table. Subsequently, queries against the parent will include records
of the target table. To be added as a child, the target table must
already contain all the same columns as the parent (it could have
additional columns, too). The columns must have matching data types,
and if they have NOT NULL constraints in the parent
then they must also have NOT NULL constraints in the
child.
<P>
There must also be matching child-table constraints for all
CHECK constraints of the parent. Currently
UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and
FOREIGN KEY constraints are not considered, but
this might change in the future.
<DT><B>NO INHERIT </B><I>parent_table</I><B></B><DD>
This form removes the target table from the list of children of the
specified parent table.
Queries against the parent table will no longer include records drawn
from the target table.
<DT><B>OWNER</B><DD>
This form changes the owner of the table, sequence, or view to the
specified user.
<DT><B>SET TABLESPACE</B><DD>
This form changes the table's tablespace to the specified tablespace and
moves the data file(s) associated with the table to the new tablespace.
Indexes on the table, if any, are not moved; but they can be moved
separately with additional SET TABLESPACE commands.
See also
CREATE TABLESPACE [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+create_tablespace">create_tablespace</A></B>(7)].
<DT><B>RENAME</B><DD>
The RENAME forms change the name of a table
(or an index, sequence, or view) or the name of an individual column in
a table. There is no effect on the stored data.
<DT><B>SET SCHEMA</B><DD>
This form moves the table into another schema. Associated indexes,
constraints, and sequences owned by table columns are moved as well.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

All the actions except RENAME and SET SCHEMA
can be combined into
a list of multiple alterations to apply in parallel. For example, it
is possible to add several columns and/or alter the type of several
columns in a single command. This is particularly useful with large
tables, since only one pass over the table need be made.
<P>

You must own the table to use <B>ALTER TABLE</B>.
To change the schema of a table, you must also have
CREATE privilege on the new schema.
To add the table as a new child of a parent table, you must own the
parent table as well.
To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on
the table's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner
doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the table.
However, a superuser can alter ownership of any table anyway.)

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

The key word COLUMN is noise and can be omitted.
<P>

When a column is added with ADD COLUMN, all existing
rows in the table are initialized with the column's default value
(NULL if no DEFAULT clause is specified).
<P>

Adding a column with a non-null default or changing the type of an
existing column will require the entire table to be rewritten. This
might take a significant amount of time for a large table; and it will
temporarily require double the disk space. Adding or removing a system
oid column likewise requires rewriting the entire table.
<P>

Adding a CHECK or NOT NULL constraint requires
scanning the table to verify that existing rows meet the constraint.
<P>

The main reason for providing the option to specify multiple changes
in a single <B>ALTER TABLE</B> is that multiple table scans or
rewrites can thereby be combined into a single pass over the table.
<P>

The DROP COLUMN form does not physically remove
the column, but simply makes it invisible to SQL operations. Subsequent
insert and update operations in the table will store a null value for the
column. Thus, dropping a column is quick but it will not immediately
reduce the on-disk size of your table, as the space occupied
by the dropped column is not reclaimed. The space will be
reclaimed over time as existing rows are updated. (These statements do
not apply when dropping the system oid column; that is done
with an immediate rewrite.)
<P>

The fact that ALTER TYPE requires rewriting the whole table
is sometimes an advantage, because the rewriting process eliminates
any dead space in the table. For example, to reclaim the space occupied
by a dropped column immediately, the fastest way is:
<P>
<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table ALTER COLUMN anycol TYPE anytype;

</PRE>

where anycol is any remaining table column and
anytype is the same type that column already has.
This results in no semantically-visible change in the table,
but the command forces rewriting, which gets rid of no-longer-useful
data.
<P>

The USING option of ALTER TYPE can actually
specify any expression involving the old values of the row; that is, it
can refer to other columns as well as the one being converted. This allows
very general conversions to be done with the ALTER TYPE
syntax. Because of this flexibility, the USING
expression is not applied to the column's default value (if any); the
result might not be a constant expression as required for a default.
This means that when there is no implicit or assignment cast from old to
new type, ALTER TYPE might fail to convert the default even
though a USING clause is supplied. In such cases,
drop the default with DROP DEFAULT, perform the ALTER
TYPE, and then use SET DEFAULT to add a suitable new
default. Similar considerations apply to indexes and constraints involving
the column.
<P>

If a table has any descendant tables, it is not permitted to add,
rename, or change the type of a column in the parent table without doing
the same to the descendants. That is, <B>ALTER TABLE ONLY</B>
will be rejected. This ensures that the descendants always have
columns matching the parent.
<P>

A recursive DROP COLUMN operation will remove a
descendant table's column only if the descendant does not inherit
that column from any other parents and never had an independent
definition of the column. A nonrecursive DROP
COLUMN (i.e., <B>ALTER TABLE ONLY ... DROP
COLUMN</B>) never removes any descendant columns, but
instead marks them as independently defined rather than inherited.
<P>

The TRIGGER, CLUSTER, OWNER,
and TABLESPACE actions never recurse to descendant tables;
that is, they always act as though ONLY were specified.
Adding a constraint can recurse only for CHECK constraints,
and is required to do so for such constraints.
<P>

Changing any part of a system catalog table is not permitted.
<P>

Refer to CREATE TABLE [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+create_table">create_table</A></B>(7)] for a further description of valid
parameters. in the documentation has further information on
inheritance.

<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

The forms ADD, DROP, SET DEFAULT,
and SET DATA TYPE (without USING)
conform with the SQL standard. The other forms are
PostgreSQL extensions of the SQL standard.
Also, the ability to specify more than one manipulation in a single
<B>ALTER TABLE</B> command is an extension.
<P>

<B>ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN</B> can be used to drop the only
column of a table, leaving a zero-column table. This is an
extension of SQL, which disallows zero-column tables.
