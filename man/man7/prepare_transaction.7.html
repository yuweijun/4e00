PREPARE TRANSACTION - prepare the current transaction for two-phase commit
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
PREPARE TRANSACTION <I>transaction_id</I>

</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>PREPARE TRANSACTION</B> prepares the current transaction
for two-phase commit. After this command, the transaction is no longer
associated with the current session; instead, its state is fully stored on
disk, and there is a very high probability that it can be committed
successfully, even if a database crash occurs before the commit is
requested.
<P>

Once prepared, a transaction can later be committed or rolled back
with COMMIT PREPARED [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+commit_prepared">commit_prepared</A></B>(7)]
or ROLLBACK PREPARED [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+rollback_prepared">rollback_prepared</A></B>(7)],
respectively. Those commands can be issued from any session, not
only the one that executed the original transaction.
<P>

From the point of view of the issuing session, <B>PREPARE
TRANSACTION</B> is not unlike a <B>ROLLBACK</B> command:
after executing it, there is no active current transaction, and the
effects of the prepared transaction are no longer visible. (The effects
will become visible again if the transaction is committed.)
<P>

If the <B>PREPARE TRANSACTION</B> command fails for any
reason, it becomes a <B>ROLLBACK</B>: the current transaction
is canceled.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B></B><I>transaction_id</I><B></B><DD>
An arbitrary identifier that later identifies this transaction for
<B>COMMIT PREPARED</B> or <B>ROLLBACK PREPARED</B>.
The identifier must be written as a string literal, and must be
less than 200 bytes long. It must not be the same as the identifier
used for any currently prepared transaction.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

This command must be used inside a transaction block. Use BEGIN [<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?7+begin">begin</A></B>(7)] to start one.
<P>

It is not currently allowed to <B>PREPARE</B> a transaction that
has executed any operations involving temporary tables,
created any cursors WITH HOLD, or executed
<B>LISTEN</B> or <B>UNLISTEN</B>.
Those features are too tightly
tied to the current session to be useful in a transaction to be prepared.
<P>

If the transaction modified any run-time parameters with <B>SET</B>
(without the LOCAL option),
those effects persist after <B>PREPARE TRANSACTION</B>, and will not
be affected by any later <B>COMMIT PREPARED</B> or
<B>ROLLBACK PREPARED</B>. Thus, in this one respect
<B>PREPARE TRANSACTION</B> acts more like <B>COMMIT</B> than
<B>ROLLBACK</B>.
<P>

All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the
<B>pg_prepared_xacts</B>
system view.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Caution:</B>

<P>

It is unwise to leave transactions in the prepared state for a long time.
This will interfere with the ability of <B>VACUUM</B> to reclaim
storage, and in extreme cases could cause the database to shut down
to prevent transaction ID wraparound (see in the documentation). Keep in mind also that the transaction
continues to hold whatever locks it held. The intended usage of the
feature is that a prepared transaction will normally be committed or
rolled back as soon as an external transaction manager has verified that
other databases are also prepared to commit.
<P>

If you have not set up an external transaction manager to track prepared
transactions and ensure they get closed out promptly, it is best to keep
the prepared-transaction feature disabled by setting
max_prepared_transactions to zero. This will
prevent accidental creation of prepared transactions that might then
be forgotten and eventually cause problems.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

Prepare the current transaction for two-phase commit, using
foobar as the transaction identifier:
<P>
<PRE>
PREPARE TRANSACTION 'foobar';
