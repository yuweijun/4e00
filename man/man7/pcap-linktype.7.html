<H2>NAME</H2>

pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported by libpcap
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

For a live capture or ``savefile'', libpcap supplies, as the return
value of the
<B><A HREF="/man/index.html?3PCAP+pcap_datalink">pcap_datalink</A></B>(3PCAP)

routine, a value that indicates the type of link-layer header at the
beginning of the packets it provides.  This is not necessarily the type
of link-layer header that the packets being captured have on the network
from which they're being captured; for example, packets from an IEEE
802.11 network might be provided by libpcap with Ethernet headers that
the network adapter or the network adapter driver generates from the
802.11 headers.  The names for those values begin with
<B>DLT_</B>,

so they are sometimes called &quot;DLT_ values&quot;.
<P>

The values stored in the link-layer header type field in the savefile
header are, in most but not all cases, the same as the values returned
by
<B>pcap_datalink()</B>.

The names for those values begin with
<B>LINKTYPE_</B>.

<P>

The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are listed here.  The
value corresponding to
<B>LINKTYPE_</B>

names are given; the value corresponding to
<B>DLT_</B>

values are, in some cases, platform dependent, and are not given;
applications should check for particular
<B>DLT_</B>

values by name.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>DLT_NULL</B>; <B>LINKTYPE_NULL</B>=<B>0</B>

<DD>
BSD loopback encapsulation; the link-layer header is a 4-byte field, in
<I>host</I>

byte order, containing a PF_ value from
<B>socket.h</B>

for the network-layer protocol of the packet.
<DT><DD>
Note that ``host byte order'' is the byte order of the machine on which
the packets are captured, and the PF_ values are for the OS of the
machine on which the packets are captured; if a live capture is being
done, ``host byte order'' is the byte order of the machine capturing the
packets, and the PF_ values are those of the OS of the machine capturing
the packets, but if a ``savefile'' is being read, the byte order and PF_
values are
<I>not</I>

necessarily those of the machine reading the capture file.
<DT><B>DLT_EN10MB</B>; <B>LINKTYPE_ETHERNET</B>=<B>1</B>

<P>

a 1-byte flag, which is 0 for packets received by the machine and 1 for

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0x40<DD>
an unmodified IP datagram (TYPE_IP);
<DT>0x70<DD>

byte order, containing a PF_ value from OpenBSD's
<B>socket.h</B>

<DT><DD>
Note that, if a ``savefile'' is being read, those PF_ values are

<DD>
Linux &quot;cooked&quot; capture encapsulation; the link-layer header contains, in

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0<DD>
packet was sent to us by somebody else
<DT>1<DD>

8 are present, and if there are fewer than 8 bytes, there are padding
bytes after the address to pad the field to 8 bytes);
<P>

a 2-byte field containing an Ethernet protocol type, in network byte
order, or containing 1 for Novell 802.3 frames without an 802.2 LLC
header or 4 for frames beginning with an 802.2 LLC header.

Apple LocalTalk; the packet begins with an AppleTalk LLAP header.
<DT><B>DLT_PFLOG</B>; <B>LINKTYPE_PFLOG</B>=<B>117</B>

OpenBSD pflog; the link-layer header contains a
<B>struct pfloghdr</B>

structure, as defined by the host on which the file was saved.  (This
differs from operating system to operating system and release to
release; there is nothing in the file to indicate what the layout of
that structure is.)
